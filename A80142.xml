            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>His text preſents you with the exaltation of the Lord Jeſus, and the manner of it.</p>
            <p>Occaſioned by a diſcourſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Chriſt Ieſus, and <hi>Nicode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus:</hi> from the beginning of the Chapter,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:119599:8"/>theſe words being a part of that diſcourſe, and they are the words of Chriſt who is truth it ſelf and cannot lie, the faithfull and true wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe the <hi>Alpha</hi> and <hi>Omega,</hi> the firſt and the laſt of all truths, and heavenly myſteries of the Goſpel.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The text divided in two parts:</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In this Scripture you may be pleaſed to take notice of two particulars: firſt, an act to be done, <hi>Chriſt lifted up:</hi> Secondly, how it muſt be done; <hi>even as</hi> Moſes <hi>lifted up the Serpent in the wilderneſſe,</hi> &amp;c. I ſhall not meddle with that title by which Chriſt is pleaſed to deſcribe himſelf (the ſonne of man) I might note that Chriſt is the ſonne of man, and ſo true and perfect man, as well as God, <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi> 3.4.</p>
            <p>But I ſhall rather pitch upon the mayne glorious Goſpell truth held forth in this Scripture, and the truth or concluſion is this.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Doct.</hi> That the Lord Jeſus Chriſt now in the dayes of the Goſpel, is to be lifted up <hi>even as</hi> Moſes <hi>lifted up theſe pent in the wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Chriſt is to be lifted up now in the dayes of the Goſpel.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Note.</hi> 1 Chriſt is to bee lifted up in the preaching of the Goſpel.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:119599:8"/>
2 In the ſoule of believers.</p>
            <p n="1">1 In the preaching of the Goſpell, and that firſt for juſtification and life, as the alone Prieſt Attonement and peace maker, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween God and his people.</p>
            <p n="2">2 He is to be lifted up as the alone Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, to teach as the alone King and Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giver to his Church and people: And this is to be done both in the preaching of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, and in the hearts of believers.</p>
            <p n="1">1 In the preaching of the Goſpel, Chriſt is to be lifted up for juſtification and life, this was the end for which Chriſt came into the world <hi>John</hi> 10.10. <hi>I am come that yee might have life,</hi> and that yee might have yet more a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundantly, ô beloved, <hi>Chriſt</hi> came to give life to dead ſoules, <hi>John</hi> 5.25. <hi>The dead ſhall heare the voyce of the Sonne of God, and they that heare ſhall live:</hi> and this life Chriſt communicates to his, in giving his life to purchaſe life for his own, who <hi>were dead in treſpaſſes and ſins, Epheſ.</hi> 2.1. <hi>And ſo freely and fully uſtifies all whom he intends to ſave, Rom.</hi> 3.24. And this juſtification although free, through the redernption that is in Chriſt, yet we come to participate of that juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by faith, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.26, 27, 28. And the preaching of the Goſpell is the Inſtrumentall
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:119599:9"/>means in the hand of God working faith, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. from <hi>ver.</hi> 14. to 17. <hi>Faith commeth by hearing, and hearing by the Word of God:</hi> therfore Chriſt is to be exalted in the preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Goſpel, for juſtification and life, that men beholding him, may have life by him.</p>
            <p>See this truth confirmed, <hi>Mat.</hi> 10.27. <hi>What I tell you in darkneſſe, ſpeak yee in the light, and what ye hear in the eare, that preach yee on the houſe tops:</hi> Note, what Chriſt doth tell his ſervants in the darke? he tells them that he is their life, and their light, their juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, reconciliation; and peace, and hee tells them in the dark in ſecret, that there is no light or life to be attained in any creature or thing beneath the Lord Jeſus, and Chriſt having called them to it, this they are to ſpeak in the light, and to preach it upon the houſe tops, that is publikely, to make it known to all, that men through the bleſſing of God may come to the ſight of it.</p>
            <p>This was the commiſſion Chriſt gave to his Diſciples, to lift up Chriſt for juſtification, and life, in the preaching of the Goſpel, ſee <hi>Luke</hi> 24.47. compared with <hi>Mar.</hi> 16.16, 17: In <hi>Luke</hi> the Text ſayes, <hi>And that repent once and remiſſion of ſins ſhould be preached in his
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:119599:9"/>name among all Nations:</hi> And in <hi>Marke Goe preach the Goſpel to every creature, hee that believeth and is baptized ſhall be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Note.</hi> In the firſt, <hi>remiſſion of ſins</hi> is to be preached; in the ſecond, ſalvation through believing: and both theſe in Chriſt, remiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of ſins in the name of Chriſt ſalvation and life through believing in Chriſt, who is the alone juſtification of believers, ſo that juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, remiſſion of ſins, &amp;c. through Chriſt is to be held forth to the view of the ſoule, that the ſoule who is a ſinner may by the power of God come to ſee the Sonne; that is to ſee that remiſſion of ſins, that juſtification that is held forth in Chriſt, and ſo come to be made partakers of it: This you ſhall ſee farther confirmed by a ſecond word from heaven, <hi>Act.</hi> 5.20. <hi>Goe. ſtand, ſpeak in the Temple, all the words of this life,</hi> that is, all the words of the Goſpel of Chriſt, the means God hath appointed by the workings of his Spirit, to diſcover life unto the ſoules of men.</p>
            <p>And ſecondly, as Chriſt thus requires it, ſo likewiſe the Apoſtles practice it, you ſhal ever finde them exalting Chriſt, ſo the Apoſtle <hi>Peter, Act.</hi> 4.12. exalts Chriſt to the heavens
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:119599:10"/>above all, <hi>Neither is there ſalvation in any others for there is none other name given un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der heaven among men whereby we may be ſaved, but by the name of Jeſus</hi> (Harke you) beloved friends, here is Chriſt exalted his name above every name, for the remiſſion of ſins, ſalvation, and thus, is Chriſt to be exal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted above all duties, creatures, every thing, <hi>Act.</hi> 5.42. <hi>and daily in the Temple, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very houſe they ceaſed not to preach and teach Ieſus:</hi> What did they teach and preach of Jeſus? they preach juſtification by Jeſus in oppoſition to all legall righteouſneſſe, <hi>Act.</hi> 13.39. <hi>And by him all that believe are juſtified, from all things, from which yee could not be ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtified by the law of Moſes:</hi> This is the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon (beloved) the Apoſtles preached <hi>Ieſus Chriſt dying, and riſing again,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.3, 4. <hi>For I delivered unto you firſt of all that which I alſo received, that Chriſt died for our ſins according to the Scriptures: And that he was buried and roſe againe the third day, according to the Scriptures:</hi> this the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched firſt of all unto them juſtification and life by Chriſt, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.25. <hi>Who was delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red for our offences, and raiſed again for our juſtification,</hi> that he dyed for ſin, and was raiſed again for juſtification, this is the firſt
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:119599:10"/>Sermon you ſee the Apoſtle preaches; and it is, that he is ever indeavouring to make it more abundantly clear to the ſoules of the Saints. <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.4. <hi>He is the end of the Law for righteouſneſſe, to all them that believe.</hi> Rom. 3.20. <hi>And that by the deeds of the Law there ſhall no fleſh be juſtified,</hi> Gal. 2.16. <hi>Knowing that a man is not juſtified by the works of the Law but by the faith of Ieſus, for by the works of the Law ſhall no fleſh be juſtified.</hi> Thus, beloved, you ſee the Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of Chriſt, they ceaſe not to teach, and preach Ieſus, that Chriſt is indeed the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiah promiſed, <hi>Act.</hi> 9.22. the very Chriſt <hi>that he died and roſe again for our juſtification</hi> that the Saints participate of this juſtification and life by faith in his bloud: thus the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle <hi>Peter</hi> came preaching and exalting Chriſt for remiſſion of ſins <hi>Act.</hi> 5.31. Him hath God exalted with his right hand, a Prince and a Saviour, for to give repentance and remiſſion of ſins, according to Chriſts commiſſion <hi>Luke</hi> 24 47. ſo is the Apoſtles practice, preaching peace by Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>Act.</hi> 10.36. <hi>Who is Lord of all.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Note</hi> And this they preached as the command of Chriſt, beloved, and not as the idle fancie of their own brain, as the ſervants
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:119599:11"/>of Chriſt are now charged by thoſe ignorant of the righteouſneſſe of God, going about to eſtabliſh a righteouſneſſe of their own, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.3. but beloved, they, and ſo, we, that are the Miniſters of Chriſt, thus exalt Chriſt, preach juſtification and peace by Chriſt, by the command of God, ſo <hi>Act.</hi> 10.42, 43. <hi>And he commanded us to preach unto the people, and to teſtifie that it was he which was ordai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned of God to be the judge of quick and dead, and to him all the Prophets give witneſſe, that through his name, whoſoever believeth in him, ſhall have remiſſion of ſins:</hi> Note, beloved, this is the command of God, where is it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded? why, <hi>Mar.</hi> 16.16, 17. <hi>he that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieveth ſhall be ſaved,</hi> that is, ſhall have his ſins pardoned, his perſon juſtified, and ſo be everlaſtingly ſaved, that is, by faith the ſoule comes to eye it, and apply it, to ſee it and to hand it: for beloved, the word <hi>ſaved,</hi> im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies all, that free, and full ſalvation, held forth in Chriſt to believers, which is a ſalvation from all their enemies, <hi>Luke</hi> 1.71. <hi>That wee ſhould be ſaved from our enemies, and from the hands of all that hate us:</hi> but eſpecially, and in the firſt place, that wee ſhall be ſaved from ſin, that we might through faith in his bloud receive remiſſion of ſins, be ſaved from
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:119599:11"/>ſin, for this Jeſus ſignifies a Saviour, ſee a bleſſed word, <hi>Mat.</hi> 1.21. <hi>Thou ſhalt call his name Ieſus, for he ſhall ſave his people from their ſins,</hi> and this ſalvation God hath com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to be preached, this remiſſion and ſalvation the Prophet witneſſeth, <hi>Ier.</hi> 31.34. ſpeaking of the Covenant of grace, the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel Covenant, he ſayth, <hi>For I will forgive their iniquity, and I will remember their ſins no more, &amp;c.</hi> and this remiſſion of ſin is to be preached among all Nations, beginning at <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> and <hi>Luke</hi> 4.47. and in ſome mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure this hath, and ſhal be performed, <hi>Act.</hi> 13.46 47 48,</p>
            <p n="2">2 Chriſt is to be exalted and lifted, as in the preaching of the Goſpel, ſo in the hearts of believers, which I ſhall indeavour to ſpeak a word unto, before I come to ſpeak of Chriſts exaltation in his offices: I ſay, he is highly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alted and lifted up in the hearts of all that rightly believe in him, ſo the Apoſtle <hi>Paul deſires to know nothing but Chriſt, and him crucified,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.2. and indeed beloved, hee that rightly knows Chriſt crucified, knows enough, therefore the ſame Apoſtle ſayth, <hi>Gal.</hi> 6.14. <hi>God forbid, that I ſhould rejoyce in any thing elſe, ſave in Ieſus Chriſt and him crucified.</hi> Chriſt crucified is a Chriſtians
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:119599:12"/>onely joy, onely delight; therefore the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle <hi>Paul</hi> prays, <hi>Rom.</hi> 15.13. <hi>That God would fill them with all joy and peace through be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving,</hi> and why? by believing, the ſoule comes to enjoy this crucified Chriſt, and ſo juſtification, and peace, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5, 1.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Queſtion.</hi> But ſome may ſay, how ſhall I know that I doe indeed exalt Chriſt in my ſoule?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſwer.</hi> Firſt, Chriſt is then exalted in the ſoule, when the Lord brings over the ſoule to look upon Chriſt, as its alone juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation. O beloved then is the Lord exalted, when the ſoule comes to ſee that there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but emptineſſe in it ſelfe, when the ſoule can through the power of God caſt down all at the feet of Chriſt, and looke upon all its own righteouſneſſe <hi>as dung and droſſe in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon of Chriſt,</hi> ſo the Apoſtle <hi>Paul Phil.</hi> 3.7.8.9. the Apoſtle having in the 5 and 6 verſes laid down what he was once in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers particulars in his own righteouſneſſe, he amongſt all the grounds, (as once he thought them grounds of comfort) one and the leaſt was, hee walked as touching the Law blameleſſe: but what things were gain that is, I counted gain, and reſted upon them, <hi>I now count them loſſe for Chriſts ſake, yea
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:119599:12"/>doubtleſſe, I count all things but loſſe for the excellencie of the knowledge of Chriſt Ieſus my Lord,</hi> and ver. 9. <hi>and be found in him not having my own righteouſneſſe which is of the Law but that which is through the faith of Chriſt, the righteouſneſſe which is of God by faith:</hi> ô here is a ſoule exalting Chriſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove all, laying all his own righteouſneſſe low, even as low as dung and droſſe in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon of Chriſt: ô what ſaith thy ſoule to this, now man, woman, didſt ever ſee thine own righteouſneſſe, or at leaſt thine own unrighteouſneſſe? hath the Lord opened thine eyes to ſee a vanity, an emptineſſe in that you once truſted? hath the Lord let forth a glimpſe of his glory into thy ſoule, ſhining down in the face of Jeſus? can you ſay, <hi>Yea donbtleſſe, I account all things but loſſe for the excellencie of the knowledge of Chriſt Ieſus my Lord.</hi> Is thy ſoule carryed forth above, and beyond thy ſelfe to the Lord Jeſus as thine alone righteouſneſſe? ſee <hi>Eſay</hi> 45.24, 25. <hi>Su ely ſhall one ſay in the Lord, have I righteouſneſſe and ſtrength,</hi> ver. 25. <hi>In the Lord ſhall all the ſeed of Iſraell be juſtified, and ſhall glory.</hi> In the Lord Chriſt thou ſeeſt thy juſtification, and in him thou glorieſt, thou canſt ſay, <hi>God forbid, I ſhould glory in any
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:119599:13"/>thing below Chriſt,</hi> Ier. 23 6. <hi>This is his name by which he ſhall be called, The Lord our righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe,</hi> the Lord our covering, our juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, this is the ground, when thou canſt look upon Chriſt as thy alone righteouſneſſe and juſtification, and ſo ſeeing an excellencie in the knowledge of Chriſt in this particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar.</p>
            <p n="2">2 A ſoule then exalts Chriſt, when it looks ſo upon Chriſt, as that it is carryed with a principle of love after him, and it is by love as it were glewed and knit up to him, ſo the Apoſtle <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.35.38. <hi>Who ſhall ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate us from the love of God?</hi> and when love conſtrains thy ſoule to follow God, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.14. <hi>the love of Chriſt conſtrains us,</hi> and when love ſo glews and knits thy ſoule to Chriſt, that thou takeſt him as the wife takes her husband, for better for worſe, as we uſe to ſay: when thon canſt follow Chriſt in all conditions, to tryall, priſons, death, nothing ſevers thee from him, when as with <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> thou goeſt forth from thine own Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, thy ſins, ſinfull companions, and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweſt Chriſt, not knowing whether thou goeſt, whether to liberty or priſon, that makes nothing with thee, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.8. <hi>By faith</hi> A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham <hi>obeyed and went forth of his own
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:119599:13"/>Countrey, not knowing whither he went,</hi> this flows from faith, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.6.</p>
            <p n="3">3 When the Lord Jeſus is the alone de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light and joy of thy heart, believe it beloved, if the ſoule exalt Chriſt rightly, he will bee thy delight and joy, thou wilt be able to ſing the ſong of <hi>Mary, Luke</hi> 46.47. <hi>My ſoule doth magnifie the Lord, and my Spirit rejoyceth in God my Saviour;</hi> there will be joy and peace come in through believing, <hi>joy unſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able and full of glory,</hi> according to <hi>Phil.</hi> 4.4. <hi>Rejoyce in the Lord always, and again, I ſay rejoyce, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4 The ſoule that truly exalts Jeſus, is ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied in the enjoying of him, and now the ſoule hath enough, when it hath Chriſt, let who will have the world, ſin, pleaſure, I have Chriſt ſayth the ſoule, a goodly porti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, now the ſoule is fitted for any condition, come affliction, perſecution, the ſoule glories in all, becauſe it enjoyes God through Chriſt in all, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.30. after the Apoſtle has mentioned his afflictions, he concludes that he will glory in all, ſee <hi>Chap.</hi> 12.9.</p>
            <p n="5">5 Laſtly, when Chriſt is all in all to the ſoule, then doth the ſoule rightly exalt and lift up Chriſt, when it enjoys a fulneſſe in Chriſt in the want of all things, and ſees an

He is meat, drink and cloathing as wee uſe to ſay, to the Saints, he is their meat and drink ſee <hi>Iohn</hi> 6.55. <hi>My fleſh is meat indeed, and my bloud is drinke indeed:</hi> ô beloved, revery believer ſpiritually eats and drinks the fleſh and bloud of Chriſt that is, lives upon Chriſt, he doth not build upon ordinary prayers, duties, no, no, give me Chriſt ſayth the believing ſoule, Chriſt in hearing. Chriſt in preaching, in the Supper of the Lord &amp;c. Believe it, beloved, nothing leſle then Chriſt can ſatisfie the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, the believing ſoule and likewiſe in tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall things, the believer ſees all purcha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed for him by the bloud of Chriſt, and ſo in every creature, he lives upon the fleſh and bloud of Chriſt, and believe it beloved, thus every beleever lives upon Chriſt, ſee <hi>ver.</hi> 53. <hi>Then Jeſus ſaid unto them verily verily I ſay unto you, except yea eat the fleſh of the Son of man, and drinke his bloud, you have no life in you,</hi> (harke you friends) Hee: that doth not thus ſpiritually eat and drink the fleſh and bloud of Chriſt hath no life in him: a

            <p n="2">2 Chriſt is cloathing and covering alſo, he covers the nakedneſſe of men and women that believe, ſee <hi>Rev.</hi> 3.18. <hi>I counſell thee to buy of me, &amp;c. white rayment that thou maiſt be cloathed:</hi> what is this cloathing? the righteouſneſſe of the Saints, ſee <hi>Rev.</hi> 19.8. <hi>The fine linnen is the righteouſneſſe of the Saints,</hi> Chriſt Jeſus is the Saints righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.30. <hi>Jer.</hi> 23.6. and ſo the Saints covering.

            <p>I ſhall now come to the exaltation of Chriſt in his offices, in the dayes of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, Prieſt, Prophet and King, in theſe is Chriſt to be exalted.</p>
            <p n="1">1 He is the great High-Prieſt of his people,<note place="margin">Chriſt Prieſt</note> and in this particular he is to be exalted in the dayes of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, that is, as the alone atonement and peace maker betwixt God and man.</p>
            <p>The Leviticall High-Prieſts under the Law were a type of Chriſt our great High-Prieſt under the Goſpel.</p>

Therefore, for my more cleer proceeding, I ſhall indeavour to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold unto you what was the Office of the High-Prieſt under the Law,<note place="margin">wherein Chriſt &amp; the Iewiſh High-Prieſts agree, &amp; wherin they differ.</note> and wherein Chriſt our Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel High-Prieſt, and thoſe High-Prieſts a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree: and wherein they differ.</p>
            <p>What their office, is, and wherein they a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, for thoſe High-Prieſts in all their ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtrations, typed forth Chriſt our High-Prieſt.</p>
            <p n="1">1 The Office of the High-Prieſt, it was to offer ſacrifice for the ſins of the people, <hi>Exod</hi> 28.29. <hi>Levit.</hi> 9. from the 1, to the 7, <hi>ver.</hi> this hath Chriſt done, he hath offered ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice for ſin, and herein Chriſt doth not onely agree with thoſe High Prieſts in offering ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice for ſin, but he differs alſo, excelling thoſe High-Prieſts, for they offered ſacrifice it is true, but it was the fleſh and bloud of creatures, a lambe, a ram, goats, buls, &amp;c. <hi>Levit</hi> 9.3.4. <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.13, 22.</p>
            <p>But Chriſt Jeſus, he offered not the bloud of goats and calves, but his own bloud, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.12, 14. his own body, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.10. Chriſt hath offered himſelfe a ſacrifice, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 5.2, Chriſt hath loved us, and given himſelfe for
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:119599:15"/>us an offering and a ſacrifice to God, &amp;c. ſo you ſee Chriſt exceeds in the very firſt, in the offering, in the Sacrifice, he offers his own body, his own bloud upon the croſſe a ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice for ſin, and indeed thoſe legall ſacrifices were but a type of Chriſt our ſacrifice, and in themſelves could not doe away ſin, but as they directed to Chriſt, therefore Chriſt is called the lamb ſlain from the beginning, or from the foundation of the World, <hi>Rev.</hi> 13.8. &amp; 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.18, 29.</p>
            <p n="2">2 The High-Prieſts by offering ſacrifice were to make a tonement and peace for their own ſins, and for the ſins of the people, <hi>Levit.</hi> 19.7. Moſes <hi>ſaid unto</hi> Aaron, <hi>goe to the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar, offer thy ſin offering, and thy burnt offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, make an atonement for thy ſelfe and the people,</hi> Chap. 15.30. <hi>The Prieſt for the unclean woman, was to offer a ſin offering, and a burnt offering, to make an atonement for her before the Lord:</hi> This was the end wherefore he went into the holy place, <hi>Cap.</hi> 16.3. <hi>To make an atonement for the children of Iſrael before the Lord,</hi> ver. 34. This Chriſt our High-Prieſt hath done: harke you beloved, Chriſt our High Prieſt hath offered ſacrifice, and by his ſacrifice he hath put away ſin, made an attonement, that is peace and reconciliation
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:119599:16"/>between God and man, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.10, 12. <hi>Being enemies were reconciled to God by the death of his Son:</hi> Nore, here is Chriſt reconciling by his death, Chriſt a ſacrifice dying, and ſo reconciling: you ſhall ſee all along the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture that it is Chriſt a Sacrifice, Chriſt dying, that is, our reconciliation, our attonement, and peace, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2.13. <hi>They which were ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times afar off, are made night by the bloud of Chriſt,</hi> ver. 14. <hi>he is our peace,</hi> ver. 15. <hi>having aboliſhed in his ſleſh the enmity, &amp;c.</hi> ver. 16. <hi>and that he might reconcile both unto God in one body by the Croſſe, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>You ſee Chriſt hath made peace by his bloud, having aboliſhed in his fleſh the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity of the Law, made reconciliation by his croſſe, ſee <hi>Col.</hi> 1.20. and making peace how? through the bloud of his croſſe, it is by the bloud of his croſſe, by his death, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he offered himſelfe a Sacrifice for ſin, that he hath made peace for all his people.</p>
            <p>Note, in this alſo, that Chriſt our High-Prieſt exceeds thoſe Jewiſh High-Prieſts: Chriſt our High-Prieſt hath indeed made peace and reconciliation for ſin, he is our peace: and that the Jewiſh High-Prieſt could not doe, their Sacrifice could not make peace farther then the ſoule was lead unto
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:119599:16"/>Chriſt, ſee <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.1. The Law having but a ſhadow of things to come, can never with thoſe ſacrifices that they offer, make the commers thereunto perfect, and ver. 4. <hi>For it is not poſſible that the bloud of buls and goats ſhould take away ſin,</hi> Chriſt hath done that which the bloud of buls and goats could not doe, that which never a High-Prieſt in the world could doe, he hath taken away ſin, he hath made peace, and every believer re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives the atonement from his hands, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.11. <hi>By whom</hi> (namely Chriſt) <hi>we have now received the atonement.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>O beloved! What doe your ſoules ſay to this? Chriſt hath wrought peace for every ſoul rightly receiving him, he hath done that which the Prieſt could not do, he hath done that, thou thy ſelfe couldeſt never have done, if the Load help thee rightly to look to him: and this hee hath done in offering himſelfe a Sacrifice for ſinne, dying upon the croſſe.</p>
            <p>How ſhould this informe poor creatures where to look for their peace and atonement? O doe not loook for it in duties, in teats, in profeſſions, it is not crying but dying that will take away ſin; it is not tears but bloud that will make peace, <hi>Col.</hi> 1.20. <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.22.

            <p n="3">3 The High-Prieſt was to bear the names
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:119599:17"/>of the children of Iſrael in two ſrones be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween their ſhoulders <hi>Exod.</hi> 28.12. ſo hath Chriſt born, not onely the names, but the ſins of his people alſo upon his ſhoulders, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.24. <hi>He hath born our ſins on his own body on the croſſe.</hi> Hee <hi>which knew no ſin, was made ſin for us, that we might be made the righteouſneſſe of God in him,</hi> believe it, belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, thoſe ſins and corruptions that ſo much trouble the ſoules of Saints, he hath borne them all himſelfe, hee himſelfe bare our ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities upon his own body.</p>
            <p n="4">4 The High-prieſt bare the names of the children of Iſrael on a breſt-plate of judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, for a memoriall before the Lord conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually: <hi>Exod.</hi> 28.29. <hi>He beares their names, and judgments before the Lord, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So doth Chriſt, our High-prieſt, beare the names of his people; yea, their nature, and judgments upon his heart, before the Lord continually: he preſents them before his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther continually. Now Chriſt may be ſaid to beare the names of the Saints upon his heart.</p>
            <p>Firſt, In his continuall preſenting them to himſelf, and Father, (without ſpot) righteous in his own righteouſneſſe, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 5.25, 26, 27.</p>
            <p>Secondly, In reſpect of their neerneſſe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him. Beloved, that that comes to a mans
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:119599:18"/>heart: comes neere him: the Saints of God are as neere unto him as his own heart: hee that toucheth them, toucheth the apple of his eye: he that perſecutes them perſecutes Chriſt, <hi>Acts</hi> 9.4. O, therefore, let men take heed how they perſecute Chriſtians; <hi>It were better a milſtone were hanged about their necks, and they caſt inco the Sea,</hi> then offend or perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute the Saints.</p>
            <p>But the Saints, whom the Lord hath, or ſhall call, are upon his heart, in reſpect of his love unto them. Beloved, the elect were up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the heart of Chriſt <hi>from all eternity: E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſ.</hi> 1.4. That was the reaſon, why he comes into the world, <hi>to take your nature, your ſins, become ſin and a curſe for ſinners:</hi> It was his love, The elect of God was ſo upon the heart of Chriſt from eternity: and hee will give his heart bloud before hee will loſe one of them. O what do your hearts ſay to this (deer brethren and ſiſters) is not heere comfort for your ſouls? ô thou art perhaps affraid whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Chriſt loves thee: this is the complaint many times of the gracious ſoule: but know this, you, to whom, God hath given faith in his Son, thou art upon the heart of the Son in reſpect of means, in reſpect of love, hee loves thee more then thou canſt love him,
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:119599:18"/>
               <hi>for God is love, John</hi> 4.26. He bears thee up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his heart (poore ſoule) and what canſt thou deſire more? ſee <hi>Cant.</hi> 8.6. ſee what Chriſt ſayth of his Church, <hi>Chap.</hi> 4.9. <hi>&amp;</hi> 6.5.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, The Saints are upon the heart of Chriſt in reſpect of his remembring of them. <hi>The righteous ſhall be had in continuall remembrance, Pſal.</hi> 112.6.</p>
            <p>O here is comfort for the poor afflicted ſouls of the Saints! it may be, you are under affliction, either externall or internal, and art ready to complain, as once <hi>David</hi> did, as if the <hi>Lord had forgotten to be merciſull, Pſ.</hi> 13.1, 2. what ever thy condition be, God hath not forgotten thee, no no, thou art upon his heart, thou art neer and deer unto him, thou art very precious unto him, <hi>he hath ſet thee as a ſeale upon his heart,</hi> and hee cannot forget thee.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> But you will ſay, perhaps, will not God forget me when I forget him? I I have a wicked deceitfull heart that gives me the ſlip, when I come to pray, and the name of the Lord is not ſo precious upon my heart as I wiſh it were many times.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> But God will not forget thee, <hi>Eſay</hi> 49.15, 16. <hi>Can a woman forget her
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:119599:19"/>ſucking childe, from having compaſſion on the Sonne of her womb? yea, they may forget yet will not I forget thee. Behold, I have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graven thee upon the palmes of my hands, thy walls are continually before me, &amp;c.</hi> O bleſſed word, the Lord <hi>will not forget,</hi> thou art not onely upon his heart, but <hi>upon his hands,</hi> alſo, <hi>ever in his ſight, his eye is ever over thee for good.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Fourthly, The Saints are upon the heart of Chriſt, and there he will keep them, <hi>Thoſe which thou haſt given me have I kept, and none of them is loſt, &amp;c. Joh.</hi> 17.12. Ah bleſſed word! able to bear up the ſpirits of the Saints, to whom God hath given faith: ô you poor doubting Chriſtians, who are ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times affraid that your hearts will deceive you, and perhaps are ready ſomtimes to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain with <hi>David, I ſhall one day fall by the hand of Saul.</hi> So thou art ready to ſay, ô this wicked heart of mine, ô this proud, this ſtub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born heart of mine, I am afraid leaſt all is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, and that I ſhall one day fall by it: O beloved, you (to whom God hath given faith) are upon the heart of Chriſt, and if thou canſt but once ſee thy ſelfe there, it is enough, thou needeſt not fear thy falling. Doſt think (man, woman) that Chriſt hath ſet thee there for
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:119599:19"/>nothing? no, no, he will keep thee there: it is true, were the power of ſtanding or fall<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing left to thy ſelfe, then thou mighteſt well doubt, but thou art kept by the power of God, through faith: 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.5. thou art preſerved at, and in the heart of Chriſt, his love is ſo to thee that hee will not loſe thee. none ſhall pluck thee out of his hands, he loving thee once, will love thee to the end, however ſome pretend a falling away from grace, after the ſoule comes truly to believe in the Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus, but it is but a vain fancie, and an imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary conceit, for it is a part of the Covenant of grace on gods part, to keep thee from fall<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. <hi>Jer.</hi> 32.40. <hi>I will put my fear in their hearts, and they ſhall not depart away from me.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Fifthly, The High-Prieſt was to beare the iniquity of the holy things in a plate of pure gold on their fore-heads, before the Lord, always, that they might be accepted before the Lord, <hi>Exod.</hi> 28.37, 38. So Chriſt bears the iniquity of the holy things of the Saints, the beſt Saints, I mean the moſt holy, is not able to performe any duty to God, but there is a great deal of ſin in it, iniquity cleaves to it, now beloved, as Chriſt hath borne all the reſt of the ſins of the Saints, ſo
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:119599:20"/>he bears all the ſin, all the iniquity of the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly things of the Saints, O comfort for the Saints, thou cauſt not hear, noe pray without ſin, why? Chriſt bears all the iniquity of thy holy things, he preſents thy perſon and pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers to God without ſpot, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 5.27. There is never a prayer put up unto God in the name of Chriſt in faith, but Chriſt preſents it, <hi>John</hi> 16, 23. <hi>Whatſoever ye ſhall aske the Father in my name, it ſhall be given you,</hi> ſee <hi>Rev</hi> 8.3. The Angel Chriſt Jeſus ſtands at the Altar, and having a golded cenſer with much in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, that he might offer it or add it to the prayers of the Saints, ô beloved, here is a bleſſed word for the ſoules of the Saints, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther particular Saints or Churches: Chriſt adds to your prayers much incenſe, the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſe of his own merit.</p>
            <p>Sixthly, The High-Prieſt was to goe once a year into the moſt holy place, within the vail, <hi>Exod.</hi> 30.10. <hi>Levit.</hi> 16.2. <hi>&amp;</hi> 34. compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.7.</p>
            <p>So is Chriſt our great High-Prieſt, <hi>Heb.</hi> 4.14. paſſed into the heavens, within the vail, into the Holy of Holies, <hi>chap.</hi> 9.12. <hi>Neither with the bloud of goats and calves; but by his own bloud, hee entered once into the holy place, having obtained eternall redemption for
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:119599:20"/>us:</hi> What doth Chriſt there? why beloved, as he hath made peace and reconciliation for his people, ſo he is entered in within the vaile to make interceſſion for them: <hi>Heb.</hi> 7.25.</p>
            <p>The ſecond particular is, wherein Chriſt and thoſe High-Prieſts dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer,<note place="margin">Chriſt excels the Iewiſh High-Prieſts.</note> wherein Chriſt exceeds them: It is true, that in all theſe Chriſt excels them, for they were but the Type, Chriſt the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance.</p>
            <p n="1">1 Chriſt exceeds thoſe High-Prieſts, as he was the Son of God, <hi>Heb.</hi> 4.14. <hi>Seeing then that we have ſuch a great High-Prieſt, Ieſus the Son of God, let us hold faſt our profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, Chap.</hi> 5.5.</p>
            <p>The Jewiſh High-Prieſts were <hi>Aaron</hi> and his ſons, <hi>Exod.</hi> 28.16. <hi>Numb.</hi> 18.1. but Chriſt our High-Prieſt is the Son of God, <hi>He was declared to be the Son of God with power, by his reſurrection from the dead, Rom.</hi> 4.</p>
            <p n="2">2 They offered the bloud of buls and goats, of lambs and rams, as you heard, <hi>Heb,</hi> 9.12, 13. but Chriſt offered his own body and his own bloud, <hi>ver,</hi> 14. <hi>Chap.</hi> 10.10. <hi>He offereth a better Sacrifice, having obtained
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:119599:21"/>a more excellent Miniſtry, by how much alſo he is a Mediator of a better covenant, eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon better promiſes,</hi> Heb. 8, 6.</p>
            <p n="3">3 They firſt offered for their own ſins, and then for the ſins of the people: <hi>Levit.</hi> 9.7.</p>
            <p>But Chriſt our High-prieſt, offered himſelf a ſacrifice for the ſins of his people only: for he had no ſin of his own, there was no ſinne found in his mouth: he was the innocent, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, harmleſſe, lambe of God, ſlaine, without ſpot, or blemiſh: <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.14. <hi>He offered him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf without ſpot or without fault to God.</hi> Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in Chriſt wonderfully exceeded the High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prieſts: they, it is true, had holy garments, made them, <hi>Exod.</hi> 28.2. typing forth what holineſſe it was meet a High-prieſt a Peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maker, ſhould have; likewiſe typing forth what perfection of holineſſe which was in Chriſt: hee was the perfection of that type, ſee <hi>Heb.</hi> 7.26. <hi>For ſuch an High-prieſt became us holy, harmleſſe, undefiled, ſeparate from ſinners, made higher then the Heaven:</hi> the High-prieſt had holy garments, Chriſt is ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe it ſelf. Beloved, here was a meet Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice, to be offered for poore ſinners: had he not been ſuch a one, hee could not have taken away ſin: therefore ſuch a one became us.</p>
            <p n="4">4 The High-prieſts they offered many ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices;
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:119599:21"/>once every yeere they went into the holy place: <hi>Exod.</hi> 30.10. <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.3. <hi>But Chriſt our High-prieſt, offered himſelf once for all, Heb.</hi> 10.10. <hi>By which will wee are ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied through the offering of the body of Jeſus Chriſt once for all; and after hee ſate down on the right hand of God:</hi> a wonderfull Goſpell myſtery! under the Jewiſh Prieſts, and there was a remembrance of ſin in the conſciences of the ſinners, though holy, and godly: for that miniſtration, could never take away ſin, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.11. that is, never take away, the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlaſting guilt of ſin: they held under thoſe ſacrifices, but preſent pardon, and ſo preſent peace, every new ſacrifice being a new re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of ſin. But by Chriſt our High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prieſt, who hath offered himſelf once for all, and by that one ſacrifice, wee have obtained eternall redemption, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.11.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> Had not the believing Jews eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall redemption by Jeſus Chriſt under the le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gall Prieſthood?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> It is true, they had but by that Prieſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood they had it not ſo ſealed to their ſouls at once, but had their peace comming in by new ſacrifices: there was ever conſcience of ſin, a remembrance of ſin, if they had had everla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting pardon come in at one ſacrifice, there
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:119599:22"/>need not to have been an offering for ſin a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.1, 2. but wee under the Goſpell, who believe, have obtained everlaſting re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption, that is, ſee all our ſins paſt, preſent, and to come, done away, by one ſacrifice, ſo that now there remaynes no more conſcience of ſin, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.1. that is, ſin doth not lye up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon the conſcience of believers unpardoned, but they ſee all done away in Chriſt.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Uſe.</hi> This may inform you of the reaſon, why ſo many poore creatures, goe without comfort: they have their comfort by fits, as we uſe to ſay, namely, when they can pray well, and their comfort comes in from their duties; an argument of a legall ſpirit. They pray to get peace from hence: theſe things will never make you perfect, that is, bring you perfect and true peace, but Ieſus Chriſt, who is <hi>the ſame yeſterday, to day, and the ſame for ever,</hi> brings in true and perfect peace, eternall redemption to the ſouls of his people.</p>
            <p n="5">5 The Legall High-prieſts were but for a time, till Chriſt: but Chriſt our High-prieſt is an everlaſting High-prieſt, <hi>a Prieſt for ever after the order of</hi> Melchiſedeck, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.5, 6. <hi>verſ.</hi> 20. <hi>Melchiſedeck</hi> was without begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, that is known, &amp; without end, ſo is Chriſt without beginning &amp; without end, <hi>Heb.</hi> 7.3.
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:119599:22"/>Hence it is that all that ever Chriſt (as hee is a High-prieſt) hath purchaſed for his people, is like himſelf, everlaſting: everlaſting recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliation, everlaſting life, &amp;c.</p>
            <p n="6">6 Laſtly, the High-prieſt entred into the holy place, within the vaile once a yeere: namely, into a worldly Sanctuary, indeed-type of Heaven, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.1, 3, 4. but Chriſt <hi>as he hath obtained a more excellent miniſtry,</hi> Heb. 8.6. <hi>ſo he is not entred into the holy place made with hands which are the figures of the true, but into heaven it ſelfe, now to appear in the preſence of God for us.</hi> Heb. 9.24. O bleſſed word for believers! Chriſt our High-Prieſt is entred into the very heavens, to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear for his people, as he undertook to bear their ſins, and pay their debts, ſo he now e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver apppears perſonally for his people, and thus you ſee beloved that Chriſt is our great High-Prieſt, and wherein he not onely an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers the Legall High-Prieſts, but alſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds them.</p>
            <p>The ſecond particular to be conſidered is, that Chriſt Jeſus as he is Prieſt, is to be exal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and lifted up in the dayes of the Goſpel, and that both in the preaching of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, and in the hearts of his people.</p>
            <p n="1">1 In the preaching of the Goſpel Chriſt is
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:119599:23"/>to be exalted, as the alone High-prieſt, the atonement, peacemaker, and reconciliation, between God and man: and that in oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to all legall righteouſneſſe, or peace, ſought for in a legall way: beloved, thus Chriſt was exalted in the days of the Apoſtles, <hi>Acts</hi> 10.36. <hi>Peter</hi> came preaching peace by Jeſus Chriſt: and in the Epiſtle to the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> it is the main drift of the Spirit of God, to diſcover, yea to exalt, to lift up Chriſt, the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone High-Prieſt, holding forth the dignity, the excellencie and utility of his office.</p>
            <p>And this was received always in the hearts of the Saints, <hi>Chriſt our High-Prieſt, Chriſt our peace,</hi> Epheſ. 2.14. <hi>for he is our peace, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now to ſpeak more punctually to the Prieſtly office of Chriſt, it conſiſts in theſe two particulars, partly in Reconciliation, partly in Interceſſion.</p>
            <p n="1">1 In Reconciliation, that is, in reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling God to man, and man to God: Now it is true, God was ever reconciled to his e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect in his Son from all eternity, for he loved them in his Son, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1.4. from before the foundation of the world: he never looked upon them but in his Son, yet ſo, as with relation to his death, ſo working peace.
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:119599:23"/>Beloved, this was the great deſigne of God in ſending Chriſt into the world to make peace and reconciliation, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.19. <hi>To wit, that God was in Chriſt, reconciling the world to himſelfe,</hi> namely the elect (amongſt the Gentiles, who were always counted for the world, ſee <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.11, 12, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) not impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting their ſins, &amp;c. This was the great work God had to doe in the world, when he ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſted that great myſtery of godlines, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.16. <hi>God manifeſted in the fleſh &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And this Chriſt hath done (beloved) hee hath perfected it, and finiſhed it, ſee 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.18. and all things are of God, <hi>who hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled us to himſelfe by Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> ſo alſo, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.10.11. &amp; <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.17. <hi>Wherefore in all things it behoved him to be made like unto his brethren, that he might be a mercifull and faithfull High-Prieſt, in things pertaining to God,</hi> why? to make reconciliation for the ſins of the people, a bleſſed word for all be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers. God is reconciled to them in his Son, God is at peace with them, this was the end wherefore Chriſt came into the World to make peace for the Saints, and to give life unto them, hence it is Chriſt ſayth, <hi>John</hi> 10.10 <hi>I am come that ye might have life, and that ye might have yet more abundantly:</hi> hence it
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:119599:24"/>is, that the Goſpel of Chriſt is called the <hi>Goſpel of peace, Epheſ.</hi> 6.15. and the <hi>glad ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings of peace, Eſay</hi> 57.7. the Covenant of the Goſpel is a <hi>Covenant of peace, Eſay</hi> 54.10. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 37.26. God is a <hi>God of peace,</hi> and at peace with believers, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.1. 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 5.23. and Chriſt is a <hi>Prince of peace, Eſay</hi> 9, 6.</p>
            <p>Thus you ſee (beloved Chriſtians) what peace and reconciliation here is wrought by Chriſt for all believers, <hi>a God of peace, a co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of peace, a Goſpel of peace, God hath reconciled us to himſelfe through his Son,</hi> for he is our peace, who hath made both one, and broken down the middle wall of partiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and made us Gentils one with the Father through faith, having aboliſhed in his fleſh the enmity, to make to himſelfe of two in one new man, ſo working peace, that he might reconcile both unto God in one body by the croſſe.</p>
            <p>The ſecond thing conſiderable is, the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner how he makes this peace, and that is firſt in bearing their ſins: 2 In laying down his life and bloud: In bearing their ſins, belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, Chriſt bears all the iniquities of all his people. <hi>Eſay</hi> 53.4, 5, 6. ſurely <hi>he hath borne all our griefs,</hi> and carryed our ſorrows, <hi>he was wounded for our iniquities, and bruiſed for
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:119599:24"/>our tranſgreſſions, the chaſtiſement of our peace was upon him, and with his ſtripes are we healed: and the Lord hath laid on him the iniquity of us all.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Note, Firſt, God laid ſinne upon Chriſt, Secondly, Chriſt bare them, Thirdly, their God condemned them.</p>
            <p n="1">1 God laid ſin upon Chriſt, All we like ſheep have gone aſtray, but he hath laid on him the iniquity of us all, it is all laid upon Chriſt, ſo that now the ſin of all the elect, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes the ſin of Chriſt, they are laid upon Chriſt, <hi>He is become ſin for us, that we might be made the righteouſneſſe of God in him.</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.21.</p>
            <p n="2">2 Chriſt bare the ſinnes of his people, God did not onely lay ſin upon Chriſt, but he bare it, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.24. he bare our ſins on his own body on the croſſe, and ſo hath born our grief, and carryed our ſorrows: this is the way beloved, by which Chriſt hath made peace for his people in bearing their ſins, there was no other way left for reconciliation between God and man, but God muſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come man, that ſo he might bear our ſins, and ſo our griefs and ſorrows, that he might be bruiſed for our iniquities, and that the chaſtiſement of our peace might be upon him.</p>
            <p n="3">
               <pb n="36" facs="tcp:119599:25"/>
3 There God condemnes ſin, and Chriſt now bears not onely ſin, but juſtice for ſin, manſins, juſtice is offended, and that muſt bee ſatisfied; Chriſt ſteps in, he takes the blow, he becomes ſurety for ſinners, ſtands in our room, and payes the debt, ſee <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.3. <hi>For what the Law could not doe, in that it was weak through the fleſh, God ſent his Son in the likeneſſe of ſinfull fleſh, and for ſin con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned ſin in the fleſh.</hi> Note beloved, God did not onely lay ſin upon Chriſt, but Chriſt bears it, and there God condemnes it, where God finds ſin there he condemnes it: God condemnes the ſin of his people in the fleſh of his Son.</p>
            <p>O what doth thy ſoule ſay to this, dear Chriſtian? before ever thou couldeſt be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled to thy God, Chriſt Jeſus muſt bear all thy ſins, and the condemnation of them in his own body. O ſee, ſee man, what a burthen thy ſins were to thy Saviour, if thou haſt any intereſt in him, follow him to the mount of olives, ſee him in his agony, <hi>Luke</hi> 22.44. ſweating drops of bloud, great drops of bloud, trickling down to the ground, this was the weight of thy ſins laid upon thy Saviour, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ever thy peace was purchaſed, ſee him upon the croſſe (bearing thy ſins and my ſins,
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:119599:25"/>man, woman (if we have any intereſt in him) and the condemnation of them) crying out, <hi>My God, my God, why haſt thou for ſaken me?</hi> beloved, it went heavy with our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Uſe.</hi> Learn hence to take heed of ſin, doe not take delight in any ſin, truly beloved, if you love the Lord Jeſus, you cannot love that which was ſuch a heavie burthen unto him, ô beloved, how ſhould juſtified ſaved per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons take heed of ſin, of every ſin? the leaſt ſin that thou canſt imagine tooke hold on Chriſt as well as the greateſt, ô therefore take heed of pride, of anger, fooliſhneſſe, va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, the leaſt ſin is much unbecomming Chriſtians: ô beloved, how ſeaſonable comes in that earneſt exhortation of the Apoſtle? <hi>Rom.</hi> 12.1, 2. Chriſt having given up him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe for your ſins, that <hi>you give up your ſelves your ſoules and bodies, a holy, living, accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſacrifice to the Lord.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2 As Chriſt hath made peace in bearing the ſins of his people, ſo alſo in laying down his life and bloud for them: beloved, before ever there could be peace and reconciliation made, Chriſt muſt dye for it, give his life and bloud for it, all thoſe ceremoniall ſacrifices under the Law were a type of a dying Chriſt,
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:119599:26"/>hence it is that he is called <hi>a Lamb ſlain from the beginning:</hi> beloved, Chriſt having undertaken to become a High-Prieſt, a peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maker between God and man, nothing leſſe then his bloud could doe it, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.22. <hi>With<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out bloud there is no remiſſion:</hi> no juſtification without bloud, Chriſts dying is a Chriſtians juſtification. <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.9. <hi>being now juſtified by his bloud, we ſhall be ſaved,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>no purging of ſin without bloud,</hi> Heb. 9.14. <hi>how much more ſhall the bloud of Chriſt, who through the eternall ſpirit offered himſelf, purge your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences from dead works to ſerve the living God?</hi> Rev. 1.5. <hi>who hath loved us, and waſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed us from our ſins in his own bloud, &amp;c.</hi> there is no pardon and ſo no peace without bloud, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.22. Thus beloved you ſee that all muſt be done by bloud, and that by the bloud of Chriſt too, the bloud of all the creatures in the world, nay of all the men in the world, was not able to redeem, to make ſatisfaction for one ſoule, nay, for one ſin, nothing leſſe then the bloud of Chriſt could doe it, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.18, 19. <hi>ſilver and gold</hi> could not doe it, <hi>the bloud of creatures</hi> could not doe it, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.5. <hi>It is not poſſible that the bloud of buls and goats ſhould take away ſin.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> But ſome may ſay, that God had
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:119599:26"/>never any thing againſt his elect, he ever lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved them from eternity, <hi>Jer.</hi> 31.3. <hi>I have lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved thee with an everlaſting love,</hi> Epheſ. 1.4. <hi>he choſe us in him from before the foundatien of the world.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> True, God ever loved his elect, and ever intended mercie and love unto them, yet he ſo loved them as with relation to the death of his Son, and from everlaſting deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined to ſatisfie his juſtice, to take away ſin and work peace by the death of his Son, and the truth is, that God had as really an eye to the death of his Son from all eternity, and ſaw it as actually then, as if Chriſt had then ſuffered, ſee <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1.4. <hi>He choſe us in him, from before the foundation of the werld,</hi> in him, with relation to his death, to his making ſatisfaction for ſin, not that God could not have made the Saints at once, and have ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved them preſently, and never have ſuffered them to ſin, but this is the way God in his wiſdome appointed to manifeſt his mercie on the veſſels of mercie: and his juſtice on his enemies, ſo that now beloved, God having appointed this to be the means to bring ſons to glory, there could never have been any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, any peace, but by a dying Chriſt, ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he is called, <hi>a Lamb ſlain from the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:119599:27"/>of the World, Rev.</hi> 13.8. and indeed, Chriſt was as a lamb ever ſlain in Gods ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, and he beheld all things as preſent, and ſaw both the work of creation, redemption, and glory of his Saints, from all eternitie.</p>
            <p>The ſecond part of Chriſts prieſtly office, conſiſts in his interceſſion at the right hand of the glory of his Father, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.34. <hi>Who is he that condemneth? it is Chriſt that dyed, year ather that is riſen again, who is even at the right hand of God, who alſo maketh inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion for us,</hi> Heb. 7.25. <hi>Hee ever liveth to make interceſſion.</hi> Beloved, this is one part of Chriſts Prieſtly office to intercede for the Saints.</p>
            <p>Note beloved, Chriſt intercedes, 1 In the Saints. 2 For them.</p>
            <p n="1">1 <hi>In them,</hi> Rom. 8.26, 27. <hi>The Spirit it ſelfe,</hi> (to wit of Chriſt) <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.6. <hi>Maketh interceſſion for us,</hi> or, <hi>in us according to the will of God,</hi> that is, God by his Spirit, help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth us to ask things according to the will of God, <hi>for we know not what we ſhould pray for as we ought, but the Spirit helpeth us, &amp;c.</hi>

            </p>
            <p n="1">1 How ſhould the Saints <hi>admire his wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom?</hi> truly beloved, the wiſdom of God as in other things, ſo in this particular <hi>(making
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:119599:28"/>peace by the bloud of his Son)</hi> is very admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, the wiſdom of God wonderfully appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in the whole work of God, with relation to the creation. <hi>Iob</hi> 37.14, 15, 16. <hi>Chap.</hi> 38.4, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and this the Saints ſhould be acquainted with, that their hearts might admire him.</p>

               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted ſuch a way, ſuch a means of recovering, of reconciling fallen man? truly none but the God of wiſdome, and therefore Chriſt is called in Scripture the <hi>wiſdom of God, Luk.</hi> 11.49. ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore alſo he is called <hi>the wiſdom of God,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1 21. <hi>we preach Chriſt the wiſdom of God, &amp;c.

            <p>How ſhould this take off from the Saints all cares and feares concerning the things of this world? he who is <hi>infinite in wiſdom; wiſdom</hi> it ſelfe hath taken care for thy ſoul, for thine eternity.

<pb n="46" facs="tcp:119599:30"/>mine anger is turned away,</hi> Beloved, God loved freely, for he loved his before they were, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1.4. he loved them <hi>freely,</hi> for he loved them when they were ſinners, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.8. the manifeſtation of it, is <hi>free, for it is not of him that willeth, nor of him that runneth, but of God that ſheweth mercie, Rom.</hi> 9.16. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.27. he manifeſts it unto them, when they would none of it, when men had rather keep their ſins then receive Chriſt, as a Prieſt, and an atonement, ſo <hi>Paul Act.</hi> 9. the Lord meets him and over powers him, when he was go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in a way of perſecution, as it is in <hi>Eſay</hi> 65.1. <hi>I am ſought of them that asked not for mee, and found of them that ſought me not, &amp;c.</hi> God firſt ſeeking and finding, cauſes the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to ſeek after God.</p>
            <p n="2">2 It is <hi>full grace and love,</hi> great love, <hi>John</hi> 3.16. <hi>God ſo loved the world, that hee gave his Son, &amp;c.</hi> O unſpeakable love, that nothing leſſe then the Son of God can ſerve for a gift, and truly beloved, nothing leſſe could have done the deed, and therefore nothing leſſe could be given from a God of love, who intended in his gift to doe good to man, <hi>John</hi> 4.9, 10. Herein is love, not that we loved God, but that hee loved us, and <hi>ſent his Son to be a propitiation for our
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:119599:30"/>ſins,</hi> and herein is the love of Chriſt ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſted to become a Prieſt, a Sacrifice, to lay down his life for ſinners. <hi>Iohn</hi> 5.13. <hi>Greater love then this hath no man, that a man lay down his life for his friends.</hi> Here is great love, love to be admired of al the Saints.</p>
            <p n="3">3 This love of God manifeſted in the Son, <hi>is everlaſting love,</hi> Jer. 31.3. <hi>I have loved thee with an everlaſting love, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in loving kindneſſe have I drawn thee.</hi> Harke you, (beloved friends) God hath loved his people from everlaſting, and he will love them to everlaſting, <hi>Iohn</hi> 13.1. <hi>Having loved his own, which were in the world, hee loved them to the end,</hi> that is, for ever: Hence it is that the kindneſſe of God is called everlaſting kindneſſe, <hi>Eſay</hi> 54.8. <hi>In a little wrath I hid my face frone thee for a moment, but with everlaſting kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe will I have mercie on thee, &amp;c.</hi> his mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie is <hi>everlaſting</hi> mercie, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 100.5. For the Lord is good, and his <hi>mercie is everlaſting, and his truth endureth to generation and gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration.</hi> His Covenant made with thee who art a believer, is an everlaſting covenant, <hi>Eſay</hi> 61.8. <hi>I will make an everlaſting cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant with them ſaith the Lord, a Covenant that ſhall not bee removed, Eſay</hi> 54.10.
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:119599:31"/>
               <hi>neither ſhalt thou depart out of it, Jer.</hi> 32.40. and hence it is that the joy of the Saints ſhall be <hi>everlaſting,</hi> for indeed, were not Gods mercies, Gods Covenants, &amp;c. <hi>everlaſting,</hi> There could he no true joy, but this is that which occaſions both true and everlaſting joy and conſolation, 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2.16. Now our Lord Jeſus Chriſt himſelfe, and God, even our father, which hath loved and given us ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting conſolation, and good hope through grace, &amp;c. Note, beloved, here is everlaſting conſolation flowing from the love of God, and truly the conſolation could not be ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting, were not that love communicated through grace everlaſting. Here is admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble mercie, admirable grace, <hi>free full, everla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3 The Saints have cauſe to admire God in his <hi>Juſtice,</hi> for beloved, thoſe two attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes of God are admirably exalted in this one particular, giving Chriſt a reconciliation between God and man, his love and his mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie is exalted, in that he to accompliſh his own end in a way of grace, gives his own Son to become an offering for ſin, to this very end and purpoſe, to reconcile and ſave ſinners, <hi>Iohn</hi> 3.16. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.19. ſuch was the love of God from all eternity, that nothing could
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:119599:31"/>hinder their deſign of grace. The Jews, that had a hand in putting Chriſt to death, ſhall have a part in that mercy and grace purchaſed by his death: <hi>Acts</hi> 2.37, 38. For they did nothing but what God in his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell had determined, <hi>Acts</hi> 4.28.</p>
            <p>Now as the mercy of God was herein admirably exalted to men, ſo is his juſtice, his ſeverity alſo, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.12. <hi>Behold, therefore the goodneſſe, and ſeverity of God, &amp;c.</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold, here is goodneſſe and ſeverity, mercy and juſtice, to be admired.</p>
            <p>Firſt, the mercy of God is here admirably manifeſted, In freely chuſing ſome, and ſecondly, his juſtice in leaving others: Firſt, <hi>His mercy in chuſing ſome in his Son</hi> to life and glory, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.23, 24. <hi>That he might make knowne the riches of his glory on the veſſels of mercy, which he had afore prepared unto glory, even us, whom he hath called, &amp;c.</hi> here is the mercy of God wonderfully made known unto the ſons of men: and note, that this mercy was never manifeſted but in a way of juſtice: juſtice muſt be ſarisfied for mans tranſgreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: now that God may ſhew mercy without any wrong to his juſtice, hee gives his Son to take upon him mans ſin, and to ſuffer for the ſins of his people, that ſo mercy and juſtice
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:119599:32"/>might meet together. An admirable worke of grace; where God ſhews mercy, and his ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice is ſatisfied. Never any mercy to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected, but where juſtice is ſatisfied: it is in vain for thee, ô man, to expect mercy out of Chriſt: there juſtice is ſatisfied, if ever thou haſt mercy, it muſt be there, therefore Chriſt calls, <hi>Matth.</hi> 11.28. <hi>Come unto me, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now, beloved, the Saints may admire <hi>of,</hi> and rejoyce <hi>in</hi> the juſtice of God: for the ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice of God is for every believer, and is as ready to plead for them, as the mercy of God. A creditour, that is honeſt, hee will be ready to acquit and cleer the principall, when the ſurety hath paid the debt, and made full ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trsfaction, and to declare, that he hath nothing againſt him: it is true the ſurety may pay the debt, and the principall not know it, and hee may be affraid and troubled; but when the ſurety ſhall come and tell him that the debt is paid, and the creditour ſatisfied; and when the creditor ſhall ſend his bond, and diſcharge under his hand and ſeal; now this ſatisfies the man, and now he is cleer, and comforted, now he walks boldly.</p>
            <p>So it may be with the poore ſoule; Chriſt hath paid thy debt, he hath ſatisfied the juſtice of his Father, but perhaps thou wanteſt the
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:119599:32"/>aſſurance of it: beloved, to whomſoever the Lord hath, or ſhall give faith, there it is ſure: the Lord hath ſent his Miniſters to proclaime it to your ſouls, <hi>That whoſoever believeth ſhall be ſaved;</hi> and here hee hath ſent his word to confirme it unto you, and if that will not ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie, thou ſhalt have his ſeal too, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1.13 And juſtice is now ready to plead for ſuch a ſoule, to acquit him, <hi>I am ſatis fied, I have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing againſt him:</hi> and ſo juſtice is thine, and for thee, who (indeed) believeſt.</p>
            <p n="2">2 <hi>The Inſtice of God is manifeſted in lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving others in a loſt condition,</hi> herein is the ſeverity of God admirably manifeſted, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially of the Saints, ſee <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.22. <hi>What, if God willing to ſhew his wrath and make his power known, endured with much long ſuffering, the veſſels of wrath made up to deſtruction?</hi> ſee <hi>Chap.</hi> 11. the elect obtained mercie, the reſt were hardened, ô how ſhould the Saints ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire at this juſtice? what? God to leave ſo many in a hardened-blinde-periſhing-con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, and ſhew mercie to me: O wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full! what ſhould God ſee in me more then in ſuch and ſuch hardened ones? what? God ſhew mercie, perhaps to one, and leave twenty, a hundred, in a hardened, loſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, and ſhall I bee one of the ſmall num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber?
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:119599:33"/>O beloved, how will the due conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of this mercie and juſtice, this good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and ſeverity of God, ſet your ſelves: work to admire God, and to praiſe him? this is the new ſong of the Saints, <hi>Rev.</hi> 5.9. <hi>And they ſung a new ſong, ſaying, thou art worthie to take the booke, and to open the ſeale thereof, for thou haſt redeemed us to God by thy bloud, out of every kinred and tongue, and people and nation:</hi> O this is that which will ſet thy ſoule a prayſing God indeed, when thou ſhalt ſee people, tongues, nations left, and thou taken out of them, ſome taken, perhaps one or two out of a family, others left; one or two out of a generation, others left; ſome few out of a City, a Nation, and others left. O beloved, the due conſideration of this one thing, will occaſion your fouls to ſing that ſong, that none elſe could ever learn, <hi>Rev.</hi> 14.3. <hi>They ſung a new ſong, and no man could learn that ſong, but they which were redeemed from the earth</hi> (called out from earthly men) <hi>from Nations, peoples tongues, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4 The Saints have cauſe alſo to admire <hi>the power, the almighty power of God, working ſalvation for them,</hi> he doth declare himſelfe to be the <hi>Al-mighty God,</hi> able to doe what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever he pleaſeth, he is able to ſave, he is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:119599:33"/>to work ſalvation for his people which way he pleaſeth, and the power of God is manifeſted in Chriſt, working ſalvation for his people, ſee <hi>Eſay</hi> 63.1. <hi>I that ſpeak in righteouſneſſe mighty to ſave,</hi> behold the Lord Jeſus is called the <hi>mighty God, Eſay</hi> 9.6. and <hi>a mighty redeemer, Prov.</hi> 23.11. <hi>and their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer is mighty, he ſhall plead their cauſe, &amp;c.</hi> and truly beloved, hee had need bee mighty, for he hath undertaken a mighty work, the redemption and ſalvation of ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, and this appears to be a mighty work, 1 Becauſe none elſe could do it: beloved, God hath done ſuch a work for his people, that no creature nor created power in heaven or earth could doe it, <hi>Eſay</hi> 45.21. <hi>There is no God beſides me,</hi> a juſt God and a Saviour, there is none beſide me, none can ſave beſide God, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 13.4. <hi>There is no Saviour beſides me, therefore in vain is ſalvation hoped for from the mount ains, truly in the Lordour God is the ſalvation of Iſrael, Jer.</hi> 3.23. Beloved, it is in vain to look for ſalvation from the hills and mountains, from creatures, or any thing beneath the Lord Jeſus, <hi>There is none other name given under heaven whereby wee may be ſaved, but by the name of Jeſus, Act,</hi> 4.12. O beloved, how ſhould the Saints
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:119599:34"/>praiſe God, and admire him for that great and glorious ſalvation he hath wrought for his people: this is the ſong the Saints ſing unto his praiſe, <hi>Rev.</hi> 7.10, 11, 12. <hi>And they cryed with a loud voyce, ſalvation to our God, &amp;c. bleſſing, and glory, and wiſdome, and thanks<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving, and honour, and power, and might, be unto our God for ever and ever, &amp;c.</hi> They ſing forth Gods ſaving power, <hi>Who is a God able to ſave after this manner?</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2 It appears to be a mighty work, excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the work of the creation, or any of the reſt of the works of God, if we conſider the ſeverall circumſtances, or concomitants there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto appertaining. Beloved, the Lord made the world with his word, <hi>he ſpake the word and it was done,</hi> but it was not a word that could ſave man being falne, no, no, beloved, there is more to be done, firſt, God muſt take upon him the nature of man, that is, the <hi>ſeed of David,</hi> Rom. 1.3. of <hi>Abraham,</hi> Heb. 2.16. he muſt bear the ſins of ſinners, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.24. and their curſe, <hi>being made a curſe for them, Gal.</hi> 3.13. and their condemnation, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.3. And to effect this great work of mans ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <hi>He that was in the forme of God, and thought it no robbery to be equall with God, was found in the forme of a ſervant, became
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:119599:34"/>obedient to the death, even the death of the Croſſe, Phil.</hi> 2.6, 7. here is a great work be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore mans ſalvation is accompliſhed: was there ever the like work wrought by God, greater then the creation? there a word doth it, here muſt be bloud, not of an ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary man, but of the Son of God, greater then the deſtroying or building of Nations or Kingdoms, here a word doth it, <hi>Jer.</hi> 18.7, 8. here muſt be bloud, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.22. Thus you ſee, beloved, the admirable power of God, manifeſted in this work of reconcilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p n="2">2 <hi>Uſe.</hi> If Chriſt be the alone High-Prieſt, the alone reconciler and peace-maker be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt God and man, as you have heard he is, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.5. <hi>There is one God and one media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor between God and man, the man Chriſt Jeſus.</hi> Then here is a word of information, to informe us of the vanity and folly of thoſe that create to themſelves other grounds of peace and comfort beſides Chriſt.</p>
            <p>Note firſt, that there are many that doe thus create to themſelves other grounds of comfort, other Saviours beſides Chriſt, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding the Lord hath ſayd, <hi>there is no other name given under heaven whereby you may be ſaved:</hi> yet believe it many there
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:119599:35"/>are, that reſt upon duties and performances, and make that the ground of their conſolati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <hi>Jer.</hi> 2.12, 13. <hi>They have forſaken me the fountain of living water, and have digged un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to themſelves, ciſterns, broken ciſterns, that will hold no water,</hi> my people, that is, not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly mine by creation, but by profeſſion, yet they forſake me, and digg'd ciſterns to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves: how doe men love to draw water out of their own ciſterns? to create comforts to themſelves, to kindle ſparks of their own fire, untill the Lord bring them off from it: <hi>Mat.</hi> 25.1, there were five wiſe virgins, &amp; five fooliſh, the fooliſh have lamps, a profeſſion, and in that they reſt, without oyle, that is, Chriſt his grace and mercie: and note, Chriſt ſayth, the Kingdome of heaven is like ten vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins, and it may be the ſtate of the Church for all that I know, men ſhall content them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves that they are members, and boaſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and comfort themſelves in it, with a name of Chriſtians, <hi>a name that they are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>live, and yet are dead:</hi> therefore it neerly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns you, beloved, to look to it: it is not e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough that you hear, profeſs, pray, or be mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of Churches, unleſſe Chriſt bee yours, there is nothing elſe can make peace but the bloud of the Covenant and many there
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:119599:35"/>are, that ſhall deceive themſelves.</p>
            <p n="2">2 See the ſin the evill, of truſting upon any thing, beneath <hi>Chriſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1 It is a vaine and fooliſh thing, therefore the five Virgins, <hi>Mat.</hi> 25. are called <hi>fooliſh Virgins,</hi> and well might they be called foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh, they content themſelves with Lamps without oile: how long is that Lampe likely to burn, that wants oile, think you? ſo that profeſſour, that wants Chriſt. It is a fooliſh thing for a man to be content with the ſhell without the kernell, the ſhadow without the ſubſtance. Beloved, all things without Chriſt, is but a ſhadow, it will prove nothing: hee is the ſubſtance of all Ordinances, and profeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: farther then you have Chriſt in them, they are dead. O how fooliſh would you count that man, that woman, that ſhould ſtrive to catch the ſhadow, leaving the ſubſtance? It is a vain thing without profit, the vanity of it is this, they deceive themſelves, they thinke they have ſomething; when they have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing. <hi>Revel.</hi> 3.19. <hi>Becauſe, thou ſayest, thou art rich and increaſed with goods, and hast need of nothing, and knoweſt not that thou art wretched, and miſer able, and poor, and blinde, and naked:</hi> this is thy folly, this is thy vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, thou thinkeſt, that thou haſt much to ſay
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:119599:36"/>for thy ſelf, becauſe thon haſt gotten <hi>a forme of godlineſſe,</hi> when the truth is that all (with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Chriſt) is nothing, nay, leſſe then no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, <hi>vanity:</hi> they cannot helpe thee, certainly Chriſt died in vaine, if any thing beneath himſelfe can ſave thee, <hi>Galath.</hi> 2.21.</p>
            <p>But ſecondly, to create comforts to thy ſelfe, beneath Chriſt, is an evill and a bitter thing; certainly, beloved, it will prove very evill and bitter one day, eyther here when diſcovered to thy ſoul, or elſe hereafter, when too late. See <hi>Jer.</hi> 2.19. <hi>Know therefore, and ſee that it is an evill thing, and a bitter, that thouhaſt forſaken the Lord thy God.</hi> An evill end bitter thing to forſake the Lord Jeſus, the fountain; and to reſt upon any other thing beneath himſelfe.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> What is the evill of it, perhaps you will ſay?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> The beſt end of it is ſorrow, certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſorrow muſt needs follow it. <hi>Eſay</hi> 50.11. <hi>Behold, all you that kindle a fire, that compaſſe your ſelves about with ſparks, walk in the light of your fire, and in the ſparks that yee have kindled, this ſhall yee have of mine hand, yee ſhall ly down in ſorrow.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Queſtion.</hi> What is the reaſon, poor ſouls walk ſo ſadly and ſo ſorrowfully?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="59" facs="tcp:119599:36"/>
               <hi>Anſwer.</hi> Is it not becauſe they forſake the Lord the fountain, and dig eiſternes to themſelves? kindle a fire of their own, and then ſit down, and thinke to comfort them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves? and hence it comes to paſſe, that ſo many poor ſouls ly down in ſorrow: it is not thy caſe poor ſoule? thou ſetteſt up this duty and that duty, this prayer, and that ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, and expecteſt comfort in them, and thou wouldeſt fain compaſſe thy ſelfe about with thoſe ſparks of prayers and duties, &amp;c. and this makes thee ly down in ſorrow, and all becauſe thy ſoule is not carryed through theſe to Chriſt, <hi>who is the ſubſtanee of all Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances.</hi>

            <p n="3">3 It is a ſhamefull thing to reſt upon any thing beneath Chriſt, certainly, beloved, it will make you aſhamed one day, either here or hereafter: ſee <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.21. <hi>What fruit had you then in thoſe things whereof yee are now aſhamed?</hi> the end of thoſe things is death.

            <p>Note firſt, God calls thee to look above and beyond all, to himſelfe, in his Son, ſee <hi>Eſay</hi> 45.22. <hi>Look unto me, and be ye ſaved, all the ends of the earth;</hi> and Eſay 55.1. <hi>O every one that thirſteth, come, buy wine and milke, without money and without price, wherefore will you ſpend your money for that which is not bread?</hi> O beloved, God would not have poor ſouls, for which Chriſt dyed, to ſpend their time for that which is not bread, he hath given Chriſt the living bread for that very end and purpoſe. God hath given his Son a <hi>Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice,</hi> a <hi>peace-offering</hi> for ſin, ſo making recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliation for the ſins of his people, he hath put in us the word of reconciliation, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.19, 20 <hi>Now then we are ambaſſadors for Chriſt</hi> (ſayth the Apoſtle) <hi>as though God did beſeech you by us</hi>
               <pb n="62" facs="tcp:119599:39"/>to be reconciled unto him, that is, to receive this reconciliation held forth by Chriſt in the Word. O beloved, what doe your ſoules ſay to this? is reconciliation and peace with God through Jeſus Chriſt worth the own<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing? is it worth the receiving? men and wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men conſider of it, <hi>Act.</hi> 13.26. <hi>Men and bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, children of the ſtock of</hi> Abraham, <hi>and whoſoever among you feareth the Lord, to you is the word of ſalvation ſent:</hi> to whom ever among you God ſhall give an eye to ſee it, and a hand to receive it, to you it is ſent.</p>
            <p n="2">2 Conſider Chriſt is ready to receive when ever you come unto him, hee will not put you off, <hi>John</hi> 6.37. <hi>All that the Father giveth me, ſhall come to me, and him that commeth to me, I will in no wiſe caſt out.</hi> O beloved, the Lord is ready to receive ſinners, the worſt of firmers, the greateſt of ſinners: believe it, the Lord never did nonever will caſt forth a poore ſinner, that comes to him in truth, that is, who the Father draws to him. See the Parable of <hi>the prodigall ſon, Luke</hi> 15.20. his father ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him afar off, ran and met him and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced him: ô the readineſſe of God, to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace poore ſinners, that come unto him! wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe <hi>Mary Magdalen, Saul, Acts</hi> 9. The <hi>betrayers and murderers of the Lord of life
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:119599:39"/>Acts</hi> 2. All which manifeſts the readineſſe of God to receive ſinners: and believe it, hee would never invite thee, he would never give thee a heart willing to come to him, did hee not intend willingly to embrace thee.</p>
            <p n="2">2 Exhortation, for the Saints: if wee have ſuch a High-Prieſt, making peace and recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliation for us; ô beloved, how ſhould this incourage us to hold faſt our profeſſion to the end, this is the uſe the Apoſtle in the Epiſtle to the Hebrews makes of it, <hi>Chap.</hi> 4.14. <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving then ſuch a great High-Prieſt that is paſſed into the Heavens, the Son of God, lee us hold faſt our profeſſion,</hi> or confeſſion, let us hold it faſt, with a ſtrong hand (ſo the word ſignifies) <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>hold faſt your profeſſion, with a violent or ſtrong hand.</hi> Now there are three things that are all moſt ready to make a poor Chriſtian (many times) to throw away his profeſſion. 1 The pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and ſtrength of corruption. 2 Inability, and indiſpoſedneſſe to that which is good. 3 Thoſe hard temptations and tryalls, that they are lyable unto in their Chriſtian pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſe. Againſt theſe three diſeaſes will flow in from Chriſt our great High-Prieſt, rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies anſwerable, even to the ſatisfaction of the ſoule.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="64" facs="tcp:119599:40"/>
The firſt is, the power and ſtrength of cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption: this is that which troubles thee, is it not, poore ſoule? ô thou haſt ſuch a body of ſin, ſuch a vile, curſed nature, thou artready to cry out, as the Apoſtle <hi>Paul. O wretched man, that I am, who ſhall deliver mee from this body of ſin?</hi> And as <hi>Eſay Chap.</hi> 6.5. <hi>Wo is me, I am undone, I am a man of polluted lips, &amp;c.</hi> and this makes thee almoſt ready to throw away thy profeſſion.</p>
            <p>To this I ſhall propound a threeſold reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, all flowing from a crncified Chriſt, from Chriſt as he is our High-Prieſt.</p>
            <p n="1">1 That all the ſins of believers, were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned in the fleſh of Chriſt, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.3. <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, it ſignifieth the pronouncing of guilt, and ſo of condemnation, upon Chriſt. Belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, Chriſt hath born the guilt and puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of all thy ſins, to whom hee hath given faith in his bloud: all thoſe luſts and corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions that ſo much trouble thee, he hath born them all, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.24. <hi>Hee bare our ſins in his own body on the croſſe, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2 He hath deſtroyed the power of all thy ſins, as hee is a High-prieſt: See <hi>John</hi> 3.8.9. <hi>For this cauſe the Son of God was manifeſted, that he might deſtroy the works of the Devill: Whoſoever is borne of God, doth not commit
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:119599:40"/>ſin,</hi> that is, as he is born of God, he doth not ſin, <hi>willingly with his mind:</hi> hee can ſay as the Apoſtle <hi>Paul,</hi> Rom. 7.17. <hi>It is no more I that do it, but ſin,</hi> that is, I (<hi>Paul,</hi> borne of God) do not ſin. O here is the power of ſin deſtroyed! though there is, and will be, the <hi>Being</hi> of corruption. So, 1 John 1.18. <hi>If wee ſay we have no ſin, we deceive our ſelves, and there is no truth in us:</hi> now conſider (belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved) is not the power of fin deſtroyed in thee? Doſt thou not looke upon it as thine enemy? wouldſt thou not be rid of it? O that is thy deſire; why then be not diſmayed, it is the condition of all the Saints, to have ſin raging in them: Chriſt hath deſtroyed the power of ſin, <hi>it ſhall not reigne over you,</hi> Rom. 6.14.</p>
            <p n="3">3 Chriſt thy High-prieſt will have thee to live, <hi>in,</hi> and <hi>upon</hi> him out <hi>of,</hi> and <hi>above,</hi> thy ſelf: therefore he is pleaſed to let alone in the Saints, <hi>A prick in the fleſh, the meſſenger of Satan to buffet them:</hi> he will have thee to fetch all from himſelf, Col. 3.3. <hi>For ye are dead, and your life is hid with Chriſt in God:</hi> dead to ſin; and dead in your ſelves, not able to act or do any thing, but as you are carried on by the power of God, <hi>John</hi> 15.5. <hi>Without me you can do nothing,</hi> Chriſt is, and will be, <hi>all and in all,</hi> to your ſouls, <hi>Col.</hi> 3.11.

               <pb n="66" facs="tcp:119599:42"/>ſin in the Saints were ſubdued, and they made perfect in this life, I mean peſonally perfect, otherwiſe they could not live by faith upon another, &amp; ſo ſhould not be in a dependencie upon Chriſt: this was <hi>Adams</hi> condition, and he quickly loſt it: but it is the wiſdom of God, and it is much for our good, to keep as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways in a dependencie upon himſelfe, where our ſtock remains: for our life, our conſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, our ſalvation, it is all hid with Chriſt in God, and therefore it is ſure, although we have not the full enjoyment of it in this world: God keeps his people always in a way of believing, and ſo cauſes them to live by faith, and when they are made meet for ſuch a way, namely <hi>perfection, perfect free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome</hi> from all ſin, that is, <hi>when Chriſt ſhall change their vile bodies, and give them glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious bodies, then they ſhall be made like unto Chriſt,</hi> but not before, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.22. <hi>Iohn</hi> 3.2. O conſider of it I beſeech you (brethren) you would fain be glorified in a ſtate of mortality, what need of faith then? this is one end why God gives faith unto his people, that they might live comfortably in their patient ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation of what God hath promiſed, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.35, 36. <hi>Chap.</hi> 11.1. <hi>Faith is the evidence of things not ſeen:</hi> not ſeen with a carnall eye,
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:119599:42"/>not enjoyed-after a carnall manner, but eyed by faith, and expected by hope, and ſo com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortably waited for. <hi>Eſay</hi> 28.16. <hi>He that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieveth maketh not haſt,</hi> therefore that which you and I have to look to, is this, whether Chriſt be ours? whatif there be luſt and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions? if thou haſt Chriſt he is thy life, 1 <hi>Iohn</hi> 5.12. <hi>He that hath the Son hath life,</hi> if thou haſt the Son thou haſt life, he is thy life, and in him it is thou art to live, he it is that is thy fulneſſe, <hi>thy all and in all.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The ſecond thing that troubles the Saints is their inabilities to performe duties: O thou canſt not pray without ſin, thou canſt not performe any duty as thou wouldeſt, and ſhouldeſt, thou canſt ſay as the Apoſtle, <hi>When I would doe good, evill is preſent;</hi> and for to remedy this, conſider and bee ſure of theſe two things.</p>
            <p n="1">1 That Chriſt hath done all for thee, ſo that thou art not to look to thine own righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe, that <hi>righteouſneſſe that is of the Law,</hi> but <hi>the righteouſneſſe that is of God through faith, Phil.</hi> 3.9. What doth trouble thee poor ſoule? ô thou canſt not pray, that troubles thee. Why, conſiderfirſt, Chriſt hath trayed for thee, <hi>Iohn</hi> 17.9. and certainly <hi>he was heardin all things that he prayed for,</hi> his
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:119599:43"/>Prayer ſtands effectuall for every believer to the end of the world.</p>
            <p n="2">2 He by his ſpirit makes interceſſion in thee, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.26. with ſighes and groans which cannot be expreſſed.</p>
            <p n="3">3 He makes thy prayer acceptable, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented in his name, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 16.23. <hi>Whatſoever yee ſhall aske the Father in my name, he will give it you,</hi> look upon Chriſt thou ſhalt ſee him per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming all righteouſneſſe, for thee that art in thy ſelf unrighteous, doing all for thee that canſt do nothing for thy ſelfe, he hath prayed for thee that canſt not pray, nay, he doth ſtill breath in by his ſpirit into thy ſoule, <hi>ſight deſirings, groanings</hi> (and ſomtimes) <hi>expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions,</hi> and then accepts of his own work is thee.</p>
            <p n="3">3 What ever thy weakneſſe is, he paſſes it by and pardons it, ſee <hi>Micah</hi> 7.18, 19, 20. <hi>Who is a God like unto thee? that pardoneth the iniquity, and paſſeth by the tranſgreſſion of the remnant of his people:</hi> thou maiſt think God hideth his face from thee, when thou ſeeſt thy Iuſts to be ſtrong and prevailing but he will turn again, <hi>he will have compaſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on on thee, he will ſubdue thine iniquities, &amp;c.</hi> ſee the <hi>Covenant of grace,</hi> that Covenant which Chriſt hath purchaſed with his blouse
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:119599:43"/>
               <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.29. ſee <hi>Heb.</hi> 8.12. <hi>For I will be mercifull to their unrighteouſneſſe, and their ſins and their unrighteouſneſſe will I remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber no more:</hi> thou art afraid thou art ſo dead, ſo unprofitable, ſo unlike Chriſt, that he will not own thee, but be aſſured, it is a part of the Covenant of grace in the adminiſtration of it, to pardon all thy ſins, 1 <hi>Iohn</hi> 2.2. <hi>If we ſin, we have an advocate with the Father, Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt the righteous, who is a propitiation for our ſins.</hi> Chriſt is thine advocate to plead thy caſe, look to Chriſt who is thy propiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation, thy peace.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> O but I have a curſed wicked nature, there is nothing in it that is good, I cannot pray nor performe duties, certainly now Chriſt hath ſhewn mercie to me, and made a difference between me and the world, he expects ſomthing at my hands anſwerable to his mercie.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1 It was the condition of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle <hi>Paul. Rom.</hi> 7.18. <hi>I know that in me</hi> (that is in my fleſh) <hi>dwelleth no good thing,</hi> thou haſt nothing that is good in thee. it is true, no more had the Apoſtle <hi>Paul, When I would doe good evill is preſent, &amp;c.</hi> thou canſt not pray nor performe that good thou wouldeſt, no more could the Apoſtle, <hi>v.</hi> 19. <hi>for the good
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:119599:44"/>that I would doe, I doe not,</hi> that is. I doe it not as I would doe, free from ſin, from cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption, <hi>evill is preſent</hi> O this is thy caſe, I know it is, and this was the caſe of the Apoſtle <hi>Paul,</hi> it is my caſe, and ſhall be thine, while thou and I live in this world.</p>
            <p n="2">2 I anſwer, Chriſt Jeſus knew very well before ever he gave his life and bloud for thee, a Sacrifice for ſin, that thou wouldeſt have a curſed nature, a diſpoſition in thee to that which is evill, even after he had ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſted his love unto thee, he knew that thou wouldeſt not be able to pray or performe any duty without ſin, nay, he never intended it ſhould be otherwiſe with thee or me, while we are in this world, and that is the reaſon he gives us ſuch comfortable words to aſſure us that thoſe corruptions committed after faith, ſhall be pardoned, <hi>Heb.</hi> 8.12. for theſe ſins are indeed contrary to the holy and pure nature of God, but hee pardons them: and now doſt think that Chriſt would give his life and bloud for thee when thou waſt an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy to him, and ſo reconcile thee to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe and Father? and now when he findes ſin and corruption in thee, inabilities to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme holy duties, &amp;c. which he knew would be in thee before, doeſt think he will now
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:119599:44"/>reject thee and caſt thee off? no, no, he will not caſt thee off, do not think it, nay know it, that God expected no better of thee, he knew that thou wouldeſt have a vain fooliſh minde, full of paſſion, pride, and the like, farther then he gave thee power to ſubdue it, he knew that without him thou canſt doe nothing, <hi>Iohn</hi> 15.5. ô therefore be not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged, look to the Lord Jeſus thy High-Prieſt, who hath reconciled thee when thou wert an enemy, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.8, 9. <hi>But God com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended his love towards us, in that while we were yet ſinners Chriſt dyed for us: much more now being juſtified by his bloud, we ſhall be ſaved from wrath through him</hi> ver. 10. <hi>For if when we were enemies we were reconciled to God by the death of his Son, much more being reconciled we ſhall be ſaved.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3 A Third thing that many times troubles the Saints, it is thoſe temptations and perſecutions they are lyable to in this world, for the name and ſake of Chriſt.</p>
            <p>For this I ſhall propound theſe five con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderations, as remedies, all flowing from Chriſt our great High-Prieſt.</p>
            <p n="1">1 Conſider that he hath made the ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of every believer ſure, <hi>Eſay</hi> 55.3. The Covenant God makes with his people is the ſure mercie of <hi>David, I will make an ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:119599:45"/>Covenant with you, even the ſure mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of David,</hi> that is of Chriſt: It is ſure the devill may rage and men may rage, but they ſhall never be able to prevail, <hi>Mat.</hi> 16.18. <hi>The gates of hell ſhall not prevail, &amp;c.</hi> Feare not hell, thy High-prieſt hath the keyes of death and hell, there ſhall not one ſoule goe in there more then Chriſt thy High-prieſt permits, therefore feare not him that can im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſon, baniſh, kill the body, and cannot kill the ſoule, <hi>but feare him that can kill both body and ſoule:</hi> be not afraid to confeſſe Chriſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore men and devils, they ſhall never be able to ſeparate between God and thy ſoule, ſee the confidence of the Apoſtle <hi>Paul,</hi> and this was his comfort, and this will be thy com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.35, 38, 39. <hi>Who ſhall ſeparate us from the love of God? I am perſwaded that neither death nor life, nor Angels nor Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>palities, nor powers, nor things preſent, nor things to come, nor height, nor depth, nor any other creature ſhall ſeparate us from the love of God, which is in Chriſt Jeſus our Lord:</hi> true it is, afflictions will come, ſtormes and tempeſts will ariſe, but you being founded upon the rock Chriſt Jeſus ſhall ſtand, ſee <hi>Mat.</hi> 25. <hi>The raine diſcended, and the flouds came, and the winde blew, and beat upon that houſe, and it fell not, for it was founded upon a
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:119599:45"/>rock:</hi> a poor weak ſoule, carryed out of it ſelfe to Chriſt, built wholly upon him, ſhall ſtand, when perhaps ſome that have ſeemed to be far more glorious profeſſors, building upon the ſand, upon duties and profeſſions, ſhall fall.</p>
            <p n="2">2 Conſider that Chriſt thy High-prieſt hath gone before thee in every condition, therefore it follows, Heb. 4.15, <hi>He was in all points tempted like unto us, yet without ſin.</hi> O how ſhould the conſideration of this helpe thee through thy temptations: art troubled with ſin? ſo was Chriſt with thy ſin, yet <hi>him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf without ſin, he was made ſin for us, that we might be made the righteouſneſſe of God in him,</hi> 2 Cor. 5.21. yea, and a curſe for ſin too, and that thou ſhalt never be, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.13. art troubled with the Devill, with temptations, it may be to pride, to the world? &amp;c. ſo was Chriſt <hi>Mat.</hi> 4. Art perſecuted? ſo was Chriſt; art contradicted of ſinners? ſo was Chriſt, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12 3. art mocked? ſcorned? ſet out at nought? ſo was Chriſt, <hi>John</hi> 8.48, 52. art accuſed perhaps for an Incendiary, or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertor of the City, of the Nation? ſo was Chriſt, <hi>Luke</hi> 23.2. <hi>They began to accuſe him, ſaying we found this fellow perverting the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3 Conſider that Chriſt hath not only gone
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:119599:46"/>before in the Saints ſufferings, whereby hee is ſenſible and feelingly ſenſible of all the Saints ſufferings, but hee goes with them, into their ſufferings. Conſider, Chriſt will be as deep in thy affliction as thy ſelf; hee takes all as done to himſelf, <hi>Acts</hi> 9. <hi>Saul, Saul, why perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt thou Me.</hi> Chriſt wil go with thee into thy affliction, <hi>Eſay</hi> 41.3 <hi>When thou paſſeſt through the waters I will be with thee, and through the rivers they ſhall not over flow thee, when thou walkeſt through the fire, thou ſhalt not be burnt:</hi> and <hi>Eſay</hi> 41.10. <hi>Feare not, for I am with thee,</hi> (what to do? not for nothing) <hi>I will ſtreng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then thee, yea I will help thee, yea, I will up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold thee, with the right hand of my righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe:</hi> and this you ſee verified, <hi>Dan.</hi> 3.25. <hi>Acts</hi> 12.7, 8, &amp; 6.25. in all which Chriſt ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſted his gracious preſence, both for ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port and preſervation.</p>
            <p n="4">4 <hi>Uſe.</hi> Is a word of conſolation beloved, all the Saints conſolation flows fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the manifeſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Gods love in Chriſt their <hi>High-prieſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Many are the conſolations that iſſues forth to the Saints from this full fountain of grace, all received in by faith: a Chriſtians juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation which he receives by faith, it comes in by the bloud of CHRIST, <hi>Romans</hi> 5.9. Beloved, it is Chriſt dying, that is a Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans juſtification, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.33. and that is the
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:119599:46"/>reaſon why the Apoſtle is ſo carefull to make known a crucified Chriſt, 1 <hi>Co.</hi> 15.3. Chriſt dying for ſin, becauſe it was the firſt truth to be received for a ſinners juſtification: but now beloved (ſuppoſing I ſpeak to thoſe that have received this dying, Chriſt as their alone ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification) I ſhall rather paſſe this firſt parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular, and come to ſpeak of the true effects of this receiving Chriſt: and all flows from Chriſt, as our High-prieſt.</p>
            <p>The firſt is reconciliation and peace with God: every man and woman that have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed received Chriſt in a way of believing, as they are juſtified; ſo they have peace with God: this is a truth, the Lord helpe you to ſee it, Rom. 5.1. <hi>Being juſtified by faith, wee have peace with God, through our Lord Jeſus Chriſt;</hi> And this peace Chriſt hath made for us, by his bloud, Col. 1.20. <hi>And having made peace by the bloud of his croſſe, &amp;c.</hi> this is a ſweet mercy, a rich grace, for a poore ſinfull creature, to be reconciled to, and made one with the God of Heaven: think upon it (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved) is not this a ground of conſolation? now God has nothing againſt thee, to whom he hath given faith in his Son; although it is true, the Devill, hee will have much againſt thee, the world, that is the men of the world,
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:119599:47"/>will have much againſt thee, for thy religion, as once thoſe againſt <hi>Daniel</hi> 6.10, 11, 12. nay, thou mayſt have much againſt thy ſelfe; yet God hath nothing againſt thee; he is at peace with thee, Chriſt hath made peace for thee: and ſecondly, thou haſt nothing now againſt God: perhaps when thou waſt in a naturall condition, before faith came, the mightieſt have ſome hard thoughts of God, like the evill ſervant in the Goſpell, <hi>Luke</hi> 19.20, 21. thou thoughteſt God to be a hard maſter: time was perhaps, that thou thoughteſt, do what thou couldeſt, yet thou ſhouldeſt be damned; but now thou ſeeſt that God hath given Chriſt to do all for thee to bear all thy ſins, to performe all righteouſneſſe, to make true and perfect peace: thou canſt ſay, or at leaſt mayſt ſay it, God hath given al faith, as the Apoſtle, Epheſ. 2.14. <hi>He is my peace.</hi> O bleſſed word! what comfort may this afford your ſouls? I ſpeak to you believers, it is your portion: what ever men may do unto thee, yet God is thy friend, hee is at peace with thee; what ever man or Devill hath againſt thee, there is nothing in heaven againſt thee, a high priviledge for poore chriſtians! that can look upon Chriſt as their peace.</p>
            <p>The ſecond ſpring that flows forth from
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:119599:47"/>hence is joy and conſolation, peace is a fruit of juſtification, joy a fruit of peace, and all flows from Chriſt our High-prieſt the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, received by faith: here lyes the ground of a Chriſtians joy; <hi>Peace with God,</hi> Rom. 15.13. <hi>The God of hope fill you, with joy and peace through believing:</hi> through believing of what? <hi>that our peace is made with God, through Chriſt.</hi> This is the alone ground of joy, I mean in the firſt place: it is true that when once a ſoul attains to this, he then ſhall have cauſe to rejoyce in every good thing of God, wherein God is honoured, or the Saints benefited, as <hi>Acts</hi> 15.3.</p>
            <p>But this is the firſt fundamentall ground of joy, Rom. 5.11. <hi>And not only ſo, but wee alſo joy in God through our Lord Jeſus, by whom wee have now received the attonement,</hi> when once your ſouls come to receive the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonement, the peace, that is, <hi>Chriſt who is our peace,</hi> then your ſouls will rejoyce indeed, <hi>with joy unſpeakable and full of glory,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.8.</p>
            <p>What do your ſouls ſay to this now? is your peace made with God? and cannot yee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce? Is God become thy friend, thy true friend, thine everlaſting friend, and can ye not rejoce? Mee thinks, your hearts ſhould leap for joy. What if thou haſt corruption
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:119599:48"/>ſtirring in thee? What if thou art perſecuted for the name and ſake of Chriſt? yet rejoyce. See <hi>Luke</hi> 6.22.23. <hi>Bleſſed are ye when men ſhall hate you, and ſhall ſeparate you from their company, and ſhall reproach you, and caſt out you, name as evill, for the Son of mans ſake, rejoyce in that day, and leap for joy,</hi> and this the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> doth, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.9, 10. <hi>Moſt gladly therefore will I glory in mine infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, that the power of Chriſt may reſt upon me, therefore I take pleaſure in infirmities, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches, in neceſſities, in perſecutions, in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſes for Chriſts ſake,</hi> Mee thinks your ſoules ſhould rejoyce in the Lord always, as <hi>Phil.</hi> 4.4. <hi>Rejoyce in the Lord always, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, I ſay rejoyce,</hi> that ſoule that hath fled to the Lord Jeſus who is the alone hope ſet before us, may <hi>have ſtrong conſolation, Heb.</hi> 6.18.</p>
            <p>The third ground of conſolation is, that the Saints are made Prieſts to the Lord, and ſo can now through Chriſt have acceſſe with boldneſſe to the throne of grace: every belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver is made a Prieſt in Chriſt, and note this by the way, that thoſe that dare attribute that name to themſelves, by way of office, it is no leſſe then blaſphemy againſt the Lord Jeſus, but every believer is made a ſpirituall
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:119599:48"/>Prieſt to the Lord, and ſo the Church. <hi>a holy Prieſthood, to offer up acceptable Sacrifice to God by Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> not <hi>propitiatory</hi> ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice, that belonged to Chriſt alone, but yet <hi>acceptable</hi> ſacrifice, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.5. <hi>Yee alſo as li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ſtones, are built up a ſpirituall houſe, an holy Prieſthood, to offer up ſpirituall ſacrifices acceptable to God by Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> Beloved, here is your priviledge, let it be your comfort, that now you are made a holy prieſthood unto God, you may come boldly to the throne of grace, <hi>Heb.</hi> 4.16. <hi>Let us therefore come boldly to the throne of grace, through that new and living ſtay, which he hath conſecrated for us through the vail, that is to ſay, his fleſh.</hi> Beloved, is not this a mercie, that God ſhould make way for ſinners to come unto his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, and to have acceſſe unto him, <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſ.</hi> 2.18. <hi>Chap.</hi> 3.12. and that with confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of acceptance: Now thou maiſt goe to thy Father, and make all thy wants known unto him, and lay open all thy wrongs before him, as thoſe <hi>Act.</hi> 4. from the 24. to the 30 verſe.</p>
            <p>The fourth ground of co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſideration that flows from Chriſt thy High-Prieſt, it is that aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of in joying everlaſting peace, joy, and glory with himſelfe in another world, after
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:119599:49"/>the reſurrection of the juſt, there ſhall be a fredome from ſin, and a freedome from ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row: a time will come when there ſhall be a deliverance from thoſe miſeries; that the beſt of the Saints are now incident unto. <hi>Note,</hi> beloved you ſhall be freed from ſin: O thou haſt a body of ſin now, and thou couldeſt be contented to part with any thing to be rid of ſin why thou ſhalt be rid of it one day, and <hi>thy vile body ſhall be changed, and made like the glorious body of Chriſt, Phil.</hi> 3.21. 1 John 3.2. Then thou ſhalt be rid of the Devill and wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked men, there ſhall be no Devill to torment thee, the accuſer of the Brethren ſhall be caſt down there ſhall be no wicked men to perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute thee; here will be a glorious deliverance for the Saints, when there ſhall be no bad thing to them, no bad perſon amongſt them: hence it is that there ſhall be no more death, nor crying, nor ſorrow, <hi>for the former things are paſſed away, Rev.</hi> 21.4. and they ſhall not onely be freed of thoſe former things, but they ſhall poſſeſſe the ſame glory with Chriſt. <hi>Col.</hi> 3.4. <hi>When Chriſt who is our life ſhall appear, then ſhall we alſo appear with him in glory,</hi> and Rom. 8.17. <hi>If ſo be that we ſuffer together with him, that we may be glorified together,</hi> and this glory is conferred on the Saints
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:119599:49"/>by Chriſt Jeſus. <hi>John.</hi> 17.24. <hi>Father, I will that they which thou haſt given me, may be with me where I am, that they may behold my glory.</hi> Note here, 1 They were given to Chriſt to the end that hee might redeeme them and ſave them, <hi>John</hi> 6.39. And ſecondly, thoſe whom Chriſt hath redeemed, he will not leave them till hee bring them into his preſence, to behold, and to be made parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers of his glory.</p>

            <head>THE EXALTATION OF CHRIST The alone PROPHET of SAINTS. CHAP. II.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Come in the next place unto the Prophetical office of Chriſt, wherein hee is alſo in the dayes of the Goſpell to be exalted. In the handling of which, I ſhall firſt ſhew you from the word of life, <hi>That he is the Prophet and teacher of his people,</hi> and
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:119599:50"/>ſecondly, <hi>that hee is to be exalted in the days of the Gospell, as the alone teacher of his people.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Firſt, that he is the Prophet and teacher of his people: now for the better proceeding in the unfolding of this particular unto you, I ſhall goe along comparatively, holding forth the Prophetick office of Chriſt, by the Prophets under the Law.</p>
            <p>Now there were three things ordinary to the Prophets under the Law, <hi>viz. Teaching, working miracles,</hi> and <hi>foretelling of things to come.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now in all theſe three, Chriſt anſwers them, yea, and excels them all, for he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe is the ſubſtance of all their <hi>propheſies, Iohn</hi> 1.45.</p>
            <p n="1">1 It was the worke of the Prophets to teach the people, ſo <hi>Moſes</hi> a type of Chriſt; both in reſpect of Law and worſhip, God taught Iſrael by him, ſo <hi>Eſay</hi> 1, throughout: <hi>Jer.</hi> 1.5, 6, 7, <hi>Chap.</hi> 2. and all the Prophets. In this Chriſt hath manifeſted himſelfe won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfully to be a Prophet: this part of Chriſts Propheticall office (to wit, as hee is the teacher of his people) may be conſidered un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der theſe three heads: Firſt, as hee was a teacher of his people, before he came in the
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:119599:51"/>fleſh. Secondly, When he was in the world Thirdly. Now he is in heaven.</p>
            <p n="1">1 before hee came in the fleſh: Chriſt taught them by the Prophets, therefore you have ever the Prophets in the Old Teſtament ſaying, <hi>The word of the Lord came unto me, Jer.</hi> 1.4. <hi>Cap.</hi> 2.1. This <hi>Peter</hi> confirms, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.20.21. <hi>For the propheſie came not in old time by thye will of man, but holy men of God, ſpake as they were inſpired by the Holy Spirit:</hi> No Scripture is of private interpretation, that is, men did not ſpeak of their own private ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, not that private men (as they call them) may not interpret Scripture, there is no ſuch thing in the word, but the truth held forth to us in it, is, that holy men that writ the Scripture, did not ſpeak their own mindes, their own fancies, but ſpake as they were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpired by the holy Spirit, and hence it is, that upon good grounds, we receive the Old Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament for Scripture, becauſe it is the Word of God.</p>
            <p>But 2, Chriſt performed his Propheticall Office when he was in the World, hee then taught <hi>perſonally</hi> Mat. 5.12. <hi>He teaches his Diſciples in the Mount,</hi> he teaches a very long Sermon, the longeſt Sermon we read of in all the Goſpel, it continues to the end of the
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:119599:51"/>ſeventh Chapter, <hi>Mat.</hi> 13.1, 2. you have Chriſt teaching multitudes in a ſhip by the Sea ſhore, hee continues his Sermon almoſt throughout that Chapter, ſpeaking to them in parables. In <hi>John,</hi> you have Chriſt often teaching, in the third Chapter, teaching <hi>Nicodemus,</hi> in <hi>chap.</hi> 5, 6, 8, 9, 10. and almoſt in every Chapter, you have Chriſt teaching the Jews.</p>
            <p>But beloved, in the third place, Chriſt is ſtill a Prophet to his people now he is in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, which is the principall thing I intend to ſpeak unto. In the handling of which I ſhall indeavour, Firſt <hi>To prove from Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture that Chriſt is ſtill the Prophet of his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.</hi> Secondly, <hi>By what rule he teaches his people now he is in Heaven.</hi> Thirdly, <hi>The manner how he teaches.</hi> Fourthly, <hi>The matter what he teaches.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1 That he is a Prophet ſtill to his people, now he is in heaven, he never fails teaching his people, he is ſtill powerfully preſent with his people now he is in heaven, <hi>Mat.</hi> 28.20. <hi>I will be with you to the end of the world,</hi> hence it is that Chriſt ſayth, <hi>John,</hi> 6.45. <hi>And they ſhall be all taught of God:</hi> and Chriſt when he aſcends promiſeth to ſend the Holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, what to do? to teach his people, <hi>Ioh,</hi> 14.26.
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:119599:52"/>
               <hi>But the Comforter which is the Holy Ghoſt, whom the Father will ſend in my name, he ſhall teach you all things,</hi> and bring all things to your remembrance: and this is the new Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, the Covenant of Grace, <hi>Heb.</hi> 8.10.11. <hi>I will give my Laws into their mindes, and write them upon their hearts, and they ſhall all know, mee from the leaſt to the greateſt, for they ſhall be all taught of the Lord, Eſay</hi> 54.13. ſo that you ſee Chriſt is ſtill teaching and leading his people as a Pophet in the way he would have them to walke.</p>
            <p>The ſecond particular propounded was, by what rule Chriſt teacheth his people now he is in heaven, and that is by his Word: the word of God is the alone rule by which Chriſt teacheth his people, now he is in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, therefore he ſayth, <hi>Iohn.</hi> 5.39. <hi>Search the Scriptures, for in them you think to have eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall life, and they are they that teſtifie of me:</hi> and Eſay 8.20. <hi>To the Law, and to the teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony: if any ſpeak not, according to this rule it is, becauſe there is no morning in them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ob.</hi> But ſome may ſay, this was before Chriſts aſcenſion into heaven.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> True, but the ſame rule holds ſtill, ſee it confirmed after Chriſts aſcenſion, <hi>Gal. Co</hi> 6. <hi>He that walketh according to this rule,
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:119599:52"/>peace ſhall be upon him, and upon the Iſrael of God.</hi> Marke it, he that walketh according to this rule, peace ſhall be upon him, &amp;c. Note firſt The Word of God is the rule of a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians life, and ſecondly, they are to walke according to it, ſee 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.18, 20. <hi>We have alſo a more ſure word of propheſie, wherento you doe well, that yoe take heed, as unto a light that ſhineth in a darke place, &amp;c.</hi> A ſure word of propheſie, that is the Scriptures, and note in <hi>ver.</hi> 20. he confirms the Scriptures for that end, <hi>Know this, that no propheſie of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is of any private interpretation, but holy men of God ſpake as they were moved by the Holy Spirit:</hi> now the Scripture brings <hi>a ſure word of truth.</hi> It is that which ought to be the rule of the Saints in all their actions, and believe it, Chriſt never teacheh contrary to this Scripture. If this be truth, how may this reprove two ſorts of people? Firſt, thoſe that caſt off Scripture, and refuſe to walk ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to it, under a pretence of being lead by the Spirit, and ſo above Scripture, refuſing to receive the Scripture, as the rule by which Chriſt teacheth, looking upon the Scripture as nothing to them.</p>
            <p>It is a very ſad thing, that men profeſſing Godlineſſe, ſhould fall into ſuch abſurdities,
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:119599:53"/>in receiving ſuch principles as are deſtructive to the very <hi>power</hi> and being of <hi>godlineſſe,</hi> how can a man walke if he have no rule? how can a man walke without his compaſſe, his line: he knows not when he is in or when he is out, ſo it muſt needs be with thoſe that caſt off Scripture, they cannot know when they walke according to the mind of God, or when they doe not.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> Chriſt hath promiſed, to <hi>write his laws in the hearts of his people, and that they ſhall be all taught of God, and that hee would ſend his ſpirit, which ſhould teach them all things, Ergo,</hi> for thoſe thus taught of God, it is to legall for them, to walke by Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſwer.</hi> Firſt, thoſe that deny ſome Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, muſt by the ſame ground, deny all: and if one Scripture be not a truth to mee, and to be received in any practice, how can I judge of the truth of another: and the truth is, that thoſe, that will believe, but on that Scripture which they have a minde to believe (rejecting the reſt) do not rightly believe any: there is the ſame ground to believe all, as to the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve one, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.20, 21.</p>
            <p n="2">2 I anſwer, If you doe indeed believe theſe Scriptures to be a truth, I make no queſtion,
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:119599:53"/>but you will anon believe the truth of the whole Scripture, theſe being opened in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring them with other Scriptures.</p>
            <p>Firſt, <hi>Chriſt promiſing to find his ſpirit, &amp;c.</hi> I anſwer, that it was a particular promiſe made to the Apoſtles moſt principally; and in ſome meaſure, to all the Saints. Two things here mentioned in this Scripture, are moſt principally to the Apoſtles.</p>
            <p n="1">1 That is mentioned, is the firſt, <hi>Hee ſhall bring all things to your remembrance, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever I have ſaid unto you:</hi> Note, the Diſciples of Chriſt were with him, ſaw his miracles, heard his word: but now when Chriſt is gone to heaven, he will ſend his ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, which ſhall bring all things that Chriſt ſpake or did, (neceſſary to be be remembred; for our information and conſolation) to their remembrance: that they might leave it upon record to future generations; and this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of the ſpirit properly belongs to the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of Chriſt, who were both eye, and eare witneſſes of all he did or ſpakes: and this may confirme us admirably in the truth of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpell, it was you ſee, written by the imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate inſpiration of that <hi>Spirit</hi> of promiſe, bringing it to the remembrance of thoſe that wrote it, and by no meanes ſerves to deſtroy
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:119599:54"/>the reſt of the Scriptures.</p>
            <p>The ſecond thing promiſed is, <hi>That it ſhall teach them all things:</hi> note, here alſo an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable word, Chriſt tels his Diſciples, that that ſpirit, he would ſend them, ſhould teach them all things, that is, all things that God intended to make knowne to man, for their rule and direction in this life: and this with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out queſtion, Chriſt who is truth it ſelf, made good to his Diſciples. Therefore I hope this doth not ſerve to deſtroy Scripture, but to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme it abundantly: for if Chriſt did (as without queſtion, it is blaſphemy to ſay hee did not) teach his Diſciples all things, then are the rules preſcribed by the Apoſtles in their Epiſtles true, and perfect rules, and you, and I are bound in duty, as wee will approve our ſelves Chriſtians, to ſubmit unto them, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive them, as the holy, <hi>promiſed truths</hi> of God.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> But Chriſt makes this promiſe not only to the Diſciples, but to all the Saints alſo, <hi>for all Scriptures is written for our learning. &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> True, but in the firſt place it is to the Diſciples, that they might leave us a perfect patern from himſelf, and in this there is much comfort for the Saints, that wee have in the
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:119599:54"/>Scripture, <hi>truth and all truth,</hi> needfull for a Chriſtian to know: and ſecondly, this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe is made good to all the Saints in its mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, God gives them his ſpirit to underſtand the Scriptures, and therefore it is, that the Apoſtle ſayth, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.16, 17. <hi>All Scripture is given by inspiration of God, and is profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, and for inſtruction in righteouſneſſe: that the man of God may be perfect and throughly furniſhed unto all good works.</hi> Note, it is the Scriptures that thorowly furniſhes or perfects the man of God, to every good worke: and wee are ſaid to be <hi>built upon the Apoſtles and Prophets,</hi> that is, the doctrine, the truth, layd down by the Apoſtles and Prophets, <hi>Chriſt himſelf be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the chief corner ſtone,</hi> Epheſ. 2.20.</p>
            <p>And for the ſecond Scripture, that <hi>God hath promiſed, to write his laws in the hearts of his people, and they ſhall be all taught of God, &amp;c.</hi> It is true, God makes this promiſe good, hee writes his law in the heart; where hee once corres in a way of grace: that is, he puts his ſpirit in them, makes them freely willing to walke according to the rule of Scripture: for the ſpirit and the word, do anſwer each other. If any man will ſay he hath received the ſpirit of Chriſt, and refuſes to walk according to the
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:119599:55"/>rules of Chriſt, <hi>hee is alyar,</hi> 1 Iohn 2.4, 5, 6. <hi>and the truth is not in him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is true alſo, God teaches all his people, <hi>they are all taught of God:</hi> but how? God doth teach, and leade into all truth, by the rule of Scripture; therefore Chriſt ſayth in his prayer, 1 Iohn 17.17. <hi>ſanctifie them through thy truth, thy word is truth:</hi> ſee then what a ſweet harmony is held forth in all the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures: <hi>the ſpirits teaching and leading;</hi> it is ſtill according to the Scriptures. The ſpirit of Chriſt, where it is, leads into truth, and that truth is contained in Scripture. Now for any man to ſay, hee hath the ſpirit of Chriſt, and yet caſt away Scripture, or for every man to ſay, hee hath the ſpirit of Chriſt, and yet caſt away Scripture, I muſt give him leave to ſay it; but he muſt give me leave not to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve him: and alſo to tell him, that it is a diabolicall lying ſpirit, that caſts away Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, if any man ſpeaks not according to this rule, it is becauſe <hi>there is no truth in him.</hi> E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſay 8.20.</p>
            <p>A ſecond ſort of people that are here to be reproved, are thoſe that pretend to be all for the Scripture, and yet walk not up according to the rules of Scripture: without queſtion, thoſe whom Chriſt teacheth, hee teacheth to
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:119599:55"/>walk according to the rules that he preſcribes them.</p>
            <p>Of theſe there are two ſorts, 1 thoſe that do not rightly divide between <hi>Law</hi> and <hi>Goſpel,</hi> between <hi>Legall rules,</hi> and <hi>Gospell rules.</hi> 2 thoſe that inſtead of following the rules of Chriſt follow the rules and inventions of men; that wait for what men will preſcribe, reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving to make that their rule.</p>
            <p>Firſt, thoſe that doe not rightly divide be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween <hi>Law</hi> and <hi>Gospell.</hi> And of theſe there are both Miniſters and people, not <hi>rightly di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viding the word of truth, as the Apostle ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horts</hi> Timothy, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.15. And this is ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance which remayns to this day, upon the hearts of many, whom I queſtion not for their godlineſſe, and honeſty; yet God hath not taught them to this day, that cleere difference betweene Law and Goſpell: and the igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of theſe men conſiſts principally under theſe five heads. 1 <hi>In not underſtanding the difference betweene Gospell Churches and the Church of the</hi> Jews. 2 <hi>Gospell Ordinances and the Ordinances of the</hi> Jews. 3 <hi>Gospel priviledges and the priviledges of the</hi> Jews. 4 <hi>the difference betweene Gospel Ministers and the Ministers of the Law.</hi> 5 <hi>The dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference between the Gospell, and the Legall Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant.</hi>

1 The Church of the Jewes, before, and the Church of Chriſt under the Goſpel: ſome ſay, the Church of the Jews was a type of the Church of the Goſpell, both Jew and Gentile: and hence doe draw this concluſion, <hi>That as the Church of the Jews was Nationall, ſo the Churches of the Gentiles under the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpell muſt be Nationall:</hi> and that it is the du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the civill Magiſtrate, to compell all in the Nation to the Chriſtian Religion: now here lyes the miſtake; 1 It is true, the Church of the Jews was typicall, the body of the Jews being the naturall ſeed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> and ſo all that was of <hi>Abrahams</hi> poſterity, were born members of the Church: the Church of Chriſt under the Goſpel, are the ſpirituall ſeed, the ſeed according to the promiſe, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.29. <hi>He is a Jew which is one inwardly, Cap.</hi> 4.16. none are to be looked upon as the ſons of <hi>Abraham</hi> by naturall generation, as they are borne of the bodies of believers un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Goſpel: ſee a cleare Scripture. <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.26.29. <hi>Yee are all the children of God by faith in Chriſt Jeſus, and if yee be Chriſts; then are yee</hi> Abrahams <hi>ſeed, and heirs accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the promiſe.</hi> Obſerve it, you muſt firſt bee Chriſts, before you are <hi>Abrahams</hi> ſeed, not <hi>Abrahams</hi> ſeed as ſoone as you are
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:119599:56"/>borne, it is by faith that ye are manifeſted to be Chriſts, and being thus manifeſted by faith, then they are <hi>Abrahams ſeed according to the promiſe: Abrahams</hi> promiſed ſeed are onely believees, ſuch as are indeed Chriſts. It is true, ſome may profeſſe faith in hypocri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie, of whom we having no ground to the contrary, are bound to receive, but none are indeed <hi>Abrahams</hi> ſeed, but they that are Chriſts.</p>
            <p n="2">2 The kingly power of Chriſt put in Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael after the ſleſh, was a Type of the kingly power of Chriſt, ruling in and over his <hi>ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall</hi> Iſrael: their compelling or enſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving thoſe that would not ſubmit to that go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, holding forth that power Chriſt hath left in his Churches, <hi>ſpiritually</hi> to ſlay thoſe that walk inordinately in any Church of Chriſt, according to that Scripture, <hi>Luke</hi> 19.27. <hi>As for thoſe mine enemies that would not that I ſhould reigne over them, bring them hither, and ſlay them before me.</hi> It is true, this ſhall perfectly be fulfilled at Chriſts ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond comming, but in its meaſure it is, or ought to be fulfilled of every true Church of Chriſt, according to <hi>Act.</hi> 3.23. <hi>Whoſoever will not he are,</hi> that is, ſubmit, <hi>to the Prophet, ſhall be cut off from amongſt the people,</hi> that is,
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:119599:57"/>cut off by excommunication; as a dead and withered branch: this is the firſt ground of miſtake between Church and Church.</p>
            <p>The ſecond is betweene Ordinance and Ordinance? they judge baptiſme to be one with that of circumciſion, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is to be adminiſtred upon infants, as well as circumciſion, and this is the ground of much confuſion at this very day.</p>
            <p>Now for the cleering of this argument, I ſhall lay down theſe grounds.</p>
            <p n="1">1 <hi>That the Scripture no where ſayth it, that baptiſme is one with Circumciſion, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it may be a deluſion:</hi> nay, to ſay what the Scripture ſayth not, is but a meere fancie, and invention of man: Now there is but one Scripture that is mentioned for this purpoſe by thoſe that ſtand moſt ſtrongly in this opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, and that is, <hi>Col.</hi> 2.11, 12. mentioning circumciſion, that, to wit, <hi>that circumciſion made with hands</hi> in ver. 11. ſayth ver. 12. <hi>being buried with him in baptiſme;</hi> here, ſay they, the Apoſtle ſayth, baptiſme is come in the roome of circumciſion: judge your ſelves, whether there be ever ſuch a word in the Text, whether it be not a meere forged and forced interpretation: but ſay they, the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle is here perſwading the <hi>Colloſians</hi> from
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:119599:57"/>Circumciſion, and therefore mentions Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme, as come in the room of it. I anſwer, this is alſo forged, for the Apoſtle doth not in any meaſure tax the <hi>Colloſſians</hi> with this errour of holding circumciſion, throughout his Epiſtle, onely in the 11. <hi>ver.</hi> he ſayth, <hi>They are circumciſed with the circumciſion made without hands:</hi> holding forth unto them, what they have in Chriſt, namely, <hi>righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe through the circumciſion,</hi> that is, the righteouſneſſe of Chriſt, for Chriſt being circumciſed, performed all the righteouſneſſe that circumciſion required. This is the firſt ground. The Scripture no where ſayth that baptiſme is one with circumciſion.</p>
            <p n="2">2 The ground why baptiſme is not one with <hi>circumciſion,</hi> is, becauſe the rule for <hi>baptiſme under the new Teſtament,</hi> is not one with the rule for <hi>circumciſion under the Law:</hi> the rule for <hi>circumciſion</hi> was, that every male childe of the naturall ſeed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> was to be circumciſed the eighth day, the rule for <hi>baptiſme under the Goſpel,</hi> is, that whoſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver believeth, man or woman. Jew or Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile, ſhall bee baptiſed, <hi>Mark,</hi> 16.17. with <hi>Mat.</hi> 28.19. <hi>Act,</hi> 8.12. Both men and wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, hearing and believing, were baptized, ſo that the command for <hi>circumciſion</hi> and
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:119599:58"/>
               <hi>baptiſme,</hi> doe in no caſe agree, the one is for males onely, the other for believers, both men and women.</p>
            <p n="3">3 Circumciſion hath its authority in other things, as namely, 1 In the circumciſion of the heart, the cutting off of ſin, luſt and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption, it is called in the fore-mentioned Scripture, the <hi>circumciſion made without hands, Col.</hi> 2.11. ſee alſo, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.29. <hi>Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion is that of the heart, in the ſpirit, and not in the letter,</hi> this was the type of circumciſion. And 2 it typed forth Chriſt his fulfilling the righteouſneſſe of the Law, to which cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion had a relation <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.25. and ſo of the Chriſtians freedome by Chriſt, <hi>Col.</hi> 2.11. <hi>we are circumciſed with the circumciſion made without hands</hi> in putting off the body of the ſins of the fleſh, by the circumciſion of Chriſt. Note, it is by the circumciſion of Chriſt, that is, by that righteouſneſſe: Chriſt being circumciſed, and ſo bound over to fulfill the Law, hath performed for us (namely) who believe.</p>
            <p n="4">4 Baptiſme hath no where thoſe titles gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven unto it which circumciſion hath, as namely, a Covenant, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17.10. A ſeale to <hi>Abraham, Rom.</hi> 4.11. baptiſme is no where called a ſeale, neither doe I read of any ſeale
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:119599:58"/>to the believer, but the Spirit of God, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it is true, this of baptiſme hath (though for all that I know) groundleſly been called a ſeale: Yet it is true, the ſpirit of God in it, may convey comfort to the ſoules of the Saints, as in other Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances.</p>
            <p n="5">5 Baptiſme and circumciſion differ in the thing it ſelfe, the one being the cutting off the foreskin of the fleſh, onely of the males, the other the dipping in or under water, of believers, men or women, <hi>In the name of the Father, Son; and Holy Ghoſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="6">6 They differ in the ends, the end of cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion was, 1 To confirme to <hi>Abrahams</hi> and to his poſterity, that Chriſt ſhould come of that ſeed, therefore it was annexed unto that promiſe, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17. No ſuch thing in bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme, that holds forth Chriſt comming, <hi>Waſhing away the ſins of believers in his bloud,</hi> Acts 22.16.</p>
            <p n="2">2 To type forth Chriſt, who being cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſed, was to performe perfect obedience for all his elect, and ſo bring in everlaſting Spirituall circumciſion, that is Righteouſneſſe: out baptiſme holds forth a conformity in the believer, to this Chriſe in his ſuffering, in his death and but all. <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.4, 5, 6.</p>
            <p n="7">
               <pb n="100" facs="tcp:119599:59"/>
7 Circumciſion was no type of baptiſme becauſe baptiſme is but a type it ſelfe: Now for one type to type forth another, I conceive is very abſurd, for Chriſt was the ſubſtance of all types, and therefore of this.</p>
            <p n="8">8 Laſtly, Circumciſion was no type of bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme, for they were both on foot many year together, all the time Chriſt preached in the world: baptiſme was the ſubſtance of circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion, then when the ſubſtance is once, ſhould the type have been aboliſhed.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> But if it be objected that baptiſm came in the room of circumciſion, becauſe that circumciſion was the means by which the Jews were admitted into the Church, and ſo is baptiſme to us.</p>
            <p>I Anſwer, I ſuppoſe baptiſme is not come in the room of it, proved, firſt it is true, Baptiſme is that which gives viſible admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance after the manifeſtation of faith into the Church of Chriſt, <hi>Act.</hi> 2.41. <hi>As many as gladly received the Word, were baptized and added,</hi> but circumciſion did not admit the Jews into the Church, for they were borne members of that Church, and circumciſed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe members: note this, if circumciſion gave admittance to the Iews into the Church eſtate, then they were no members before
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:119599:59"/>they were circumciſed, and then the Iews when they came over <hi>Jordan,</hi> into the land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> were no Church of God, for there was none circumciſed but <hi>Joſhua</hi> and <hi>Caleb,</hi> as you may ſee, <hi>Ioſ.</hi> 5.2. where circumciſion is renewed: but it was an Ordinance God required of the children of Iſrael meerly cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniall and typicall, as all the reſt of the Iews ordinances were: thus you ſee, what a great miſtake here lies in the not rightly dividing between Ordinance and Ordinance.</p>
            <p>A third ground of mens ignorance is, in not underſtanding the difference between the Iews priviledges, and the priviledges of the Goſpel: hence it is that men are ready to ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue for Goſpel priviledges: O ſay they, it was the Iews priviledge, that their children ſhould bee circumciſed, and is the Goſpel ſtraiter? have not Chriſtians more priviledge under the Goſpel, then the Iews under the Law? is there not more liberty, grace and glory under the Goſpel then under the Law? Why then ſhould not the infants of believers be baptized, as well as <hi>Abrahams</hi> naturall ſeed circumciſed?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> It is true, there is indeed, more liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, grace and glory under the Goſpel then un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Law: but wee are to underſtand what the Chriſtians priviledge is: The Iews
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:119599:60"/>Priviledges would be a chriſtians bondege: this you ſay was the Iews priviledge, that their children were to be circumciſed: it was ſuch a priviledge, as bindes them over to the whole Law, <hi>Rev.</hi> 2.25. <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.3. but perhaps you will ſay, <hi>What advantage then had the Iews, land what profit is there in circumciſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on?</hi> Rom. 3.1. <hi>that is, what benefit then had the Jews by circumciſions?</hi> ſee <hi>verſe</hi> the ſecond, much every way, <hi>chiefely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that unto them were committed the Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles of God, the Oracles,</hi> that is, the Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of God was amongſt them, namely, cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion and worſhips, &amp;c. wherein Chriſt was typed forth to thoſe which had faith, the world being without thoſe Ordinances wherein Chriſt was thus prefigued.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Queſt.</hi> But what are our priviledges un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Goſpel?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> We have the <hi>ſubſtance,</hi> they had but the <hi>ſhadow:</hi> we have Chriſt indeed, as a Church of Chriſt: they had but the <hi>Type,</hi> we have the righteouſneſſe typed forth to them in circumciſion: they had the Oracles of God amongſt them, theſe were priviledges unto them, yet indeed were held under much bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage by thoſe Oracles, the Law ever ready to condemne them: our priviledge is, that Chriſt hath ſet us at liberty from theſe priviledges.
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:119599:60"/>which would be to us indeed yoaks of bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.1. And he hath made the Law, A <hi>Law of liberty</hi> to the Saints, that they may rejoyce in that Law, from which they are ſet it liberty by Chriſt.</p>
            <p>In a word, there is never a priviledge that can be mentioned that the Iew enjoyes, but would be a Chriſtians bondage.</p>
            <p>The Chriſtians priviledges under the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, they are all ſpirituall, and ſo are their Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.3. <hi>We are the circumciſion that worſhip God in the Spirit, and rejoyce in Chriſt Ieſus, having no confidence in the fleſh.</hi> So that (in a word) the Chriſtians priviledge is, that they have received Chriſt the ſum of all the Iews priviledges, ceremonies and ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices, all is in Chriſt, which the Chriſtian onely by faith enjoyes.</p>
            <p>Tell mee, what priviledge it is for a poore infant to have a little water ſprinkled upon him? will it confer grace, or will it not? will it regenerate, as you have been taught? O Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance! the Lord cauſe it to vaniſh: can the Infant, if elected, make any uſe of this orodinance, or receive any thing held forth in it, to the eye faith? nay, he cannot: faith is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired in thoſe that participate of Goſpell ordinances; and indeed, men and women, or
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:119599:61"/>to be baptized, becauſe they are regenerate not to regenerate them.</p>
            <p>God owned the Jews under a covenant of works, and ſo indeed (for the moſt part of them) they were but a carnall people: and they had carnall, typicall ordinances, and a <hi>worldly ſanctuary,</hi> Heb. 9.1, 2. but God own<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his church under the Goſpell, in a cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of grace, <hi>Acts</hi> 20.28. <hi>Heb.</hi> 8.10, 11. hath given us more ſpirituall ordinances, and theſe ordinances, are always preſented to the eye of faith, in thoſe that receive it: our priviledge is that wee are freed from the covenant of works and bondage, under which the Jews were held, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.1, 2, 3. <hi>verſ.</hi> 13. and ſo being free from that covenant, <hi>Heb.</hi> 8.7, 8. are freed alſo from thoſe carnall, and legall ordinances, from all fleſhly and carnall priviledges, in the <hi>ſpirituall</hi> enjoyment of the ſubſtance of all, Chriſt Jeſus, <hi>who is our light and life; our All in all.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A fourth ground of mens comming ſhort, and not walking up according to the rules of Scripture; is, <hi>in not underſtanding the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence between Prieſt and Prieſt:</hi> and this may be taken notice of under a twofold conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration.</p>
            <p>Firſt, in not underſtanding the difference
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:119599:61"/>between the Iewiſh High-Prieſt the type, and Chriſt our High-Prieſt the ſubſtance, who hath in deed <hi>made preſent peace and reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation for all his people.</hi> Hence it is, that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny agracious ſoule, comes ſhort of that peace, of that conſolation, which otherwiſe they might enjoy, and not eying Chriſt their Prieſt and Sacrifice, they themſelves are ever ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crificing for peace, and yet no longer then they are offering ſacrifice, can they have peace; and ſo they come ſhort of walking up with God according to the Goſpel, <hi>being filled with joy and peace through believing.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The ſecond is, in expecting that from thoſe, who (indeed falſly) have appropriated that title of Prieſt to themſelves: which they are to expect from Chriſt, as namely, <hi>Teaching.</hi> O how have thoſe men been, and ſtill are to this day, ſet up as Chriſt, amongſt many people, making their words their rule? as if it were not poſſible ſuch learned men might erre; and I conceive it ariſes partly from the miſunder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding of that Scripture, <hi>Mal.</hi> 2.7. <hi>The Prieſts lips ſhould preſerve knowledge, and they ſhould ſeek the law at his mouth, for he is the meſſenger of the Lord of hosts.</hi> Now this u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſually is applyed to the Miniſters, who have given themſelves the title of Prieſts, and that
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:119599:62"/>the people ſhould ſeeke the law at their mouthes: and indeed, they themſelves have done, what in them lyes, not only to bring people into this errour, this ignorance, but to keep them in it; whereas Chriſt is indeed the alone Prieſt, the ſubſtance of the lews type; <hi>And the people are to ſeek the Law at his mouth, for hee is the meſſenger of the Lord of hoasts,</hi> he is called the <hi>meſſenger of the cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, Mal.</hi> 3.1. the alone Prophet and Tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher of his people.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> But Chriſt hath appointed Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters to teach his people: are not the people to ſeek the Law at their mouthes?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. Not by vertue of that Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, for Chriſt is the alone Prieſt, and there is none in that office beſide him: though it is true all the Saints are Prieſts, and the Church a holy Prieſthood.</p>
            <p n="2">2 Wee are to receive nothing from any man as truth but what hee brings from Chriſt; and therefore our duty is to try all things, and hold faſt that which is good. We are men ſubject to errour, and it is our duty, to try the truth of what is delivered, and not receive any thing becauſe, another ſayth it; but ſee whether the Lord hath ſaid it: therefore the Apoſtle ſayth, <hi>Gal.</hi> 1.8. <hi>If I, or
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:119599:62"/>an Angell from Heaven, teach you any other dectrine, then that you have received, hold him accuſed:</hi> And the Noble <hi>Bereans</hi> were commended for ſearching the Scriptures, to try, if thoſe things preached were truth, <hi>Acts</hi> 17.11. If the <hi>Bereuns</hi> try the truth of <hi>Pauls</hi> doctrine, by the Scriptures, who ſpake by di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine inſpiration from Chriſt, much more ſhould you ſearch and try the truth of things delivered; and not build your faith upon any others word, but the word of Chriſt, your High-Prieſt, who keepeth knowledge for you, and hath promiſed to teach you, <hi>Eſay</hi> 54.13.</p>
            <p>The fifth and laſt ground of mens (I meane ſtill thoſe that have ſome knowledge of God) comming ſhort of anſwering the rules of the Goſpel, is their ignorance, in not underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the difference between covenant and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant.</p>
            <p>God owned the lews as they were a body, a Church, under a covenant of works, but the church of the Goſpel under a covenant of grace: It is true, the covenant God made with <hi>Abraham Gen.</hi> 17. from the firſt verſe no the fifth, is a covenant of grace, and by vertue of that covenant he promiſed to be 2 God to <hi>Abrahams</hi> naturall ſeed, but he ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:119599:63"/>owned <hi>Abrahams</hi> naturall ſeed in a cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of grace, if ſo, then they muſt all of them have been ſaved, for the covenant of grace is ſure to thoſe that were under it, ſee <hi>Eſay</hi> 55.3. it is called <hi>An everlaſting covenant, even the ſure mercies of David,</hi> Ier. 32.40. <hi>I will make an everlaſting Covenant with them, that I will not turne away from them to doe them good, but will put my feare in them, and they ſhall not depart from me.</hi> But God never made ſuch a covenant with <hi>Abrahams</hi> naturall ſeed, nay the truth is, that God never intended ſuch a thing, neither to <hi>Abraham</hi> nor any man in the world, to make a covenant of grace with their naturall ſeed, for God himſelfe ſayth of the Iews, the ſeed of <hi>Abraham, Though the number of the children of Iſrael be as the ſand of the ſea, yet but a remnant of them ſhall be ſaved, Eſay</hi> 10.22, 23. with <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.27. now the covenant under which God owns his church, under the Goſpel, is an everlaſting covenant, <hi>Heb.</hi> 8.10, 11, 12. when God promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth this covenant in <hi>Ier.</hi> 31.3, 32. Behold, that day is come (ſayth the Lord) <hi>That I well make a new covenant, not according to the covenant I made with their fathers, when I took them by the hand, to bring them forth out of the land of Egypt, which covenant they brake, &amp;c.</hi>
               <pb n="109" facs="tcp:119599:63"/>This covenant of works it was under which God owns the children of Iſrael as a church, to which circumciſion hath a relation, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore called <hi>a covenant, Gen.</hi> 17.10. binding to to this covenant, the Law, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.3. <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.25.</p>
            <p>Now there are two evils that uſually flow from this miſunderſtanding of the, co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant.</p>
            <p>The firſt is this, (that ſeeing the cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants are one and the ſame, under which God owned the church of the Iews under the Law, and now owns the church <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">

<pb n="110" facs="tcp:119599:64"/>Goſpel? It is almoſt impoſſible, nay, I had almoſt ſayd altogether impoſſible, if God doe not mightily work to perſwade them, that Chriſt Jeſus as a Son over his own houſe, is faithfull in all things, giving exact rules in every particular, for the well ordering and governing of his houſe, that is, the Church, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.15. and for the adminiſtration of every ordinance: although <hi>Moſes</hi> himſelfe hath ſayd. <hi>Deut.</hi> 18.15. <hi>A Prophet ſhall the Lord thy God raiſe up unto thee of thy bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, like unto me, him ſhall yee hear,</hi> If the Lord <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">

            <p>A ſecond evill, that flows from hence is this, many a poore ſoul (for want of a cleer appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hending of the differe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce between the covena<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>n, the one of works the other of grace) are held under much ſlaviſh feare and legall bondage; the poore creature lookes upon the law, the covenant from Mount <hi>Sinay,</hi> (<hi>Exod.</hi> 19. &amp; 20. chapters.) Where is nothing, but feare and dread: and hence it is, that no longer then the creature can worke, can it have comfort; and the reaſon is, becauſe it hath been ever ſet up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:119599:64"/>working out ſalvation, not remembring that bleſſed word of truth, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.18. to 23. <hi>For ye are not come to the mount that might not be touched, and that burned with fire, nor unto blackneſſe and darkneſſe and tempeſt, &amp;c. ver.</hi> 23. <hi>but unto mount Sion, &amp;c.</hi> Believers are not come to <hi>mount Sinay, to burnings, blackneſſe, and darkneſſe,</hi> they are not called to a cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant wherein is the adminiſtration of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation; that is done away to believers, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.7, 11. But they are come in deed <hi>to mount Sion, to the city of the living God,</hi> to the covenant of Grace, where is mercy and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don in its adminiſtration, <hi>Heb.</hi> 8.12. <hi>To the bloud of ſprinkling which ſpeaketh better things then that of Abel,</hi> where is nothing but cauſe of joy and gladneſſe: <hi>joy unspeakable and full of glory,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.8.

            <p>Thus have I plainly (though very briefly) endevoured to lay open the grounds, or true cauſes why, many men and women, though otherwiſe godly; yet come ſhort of walking up with God according to Scripture rules: I muſt leave it to the great Prophet Chriſt to reach your ſouls.</p>

The ſecond ſort of people, that comes here, to be reproved, are thoſe that pretend to be for Scripture, yet indeed, doe make the preſcriptions of men their rule: that reſolve, what ever the Magiſtrate requires or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, they will do: a very ſad thing! and as much to be lamented, that ever men that would be counted Chriſtians, ſhould ſet up man in the room of God, ſee what a dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full curſe is pronounced upon ſuch, <hi>Jer.</hi> 17.5, 6. <hi>Thus ſayth the Lord</hi> (note, it is the word of God) <hi>curſed be the man that truſteth in man, and maketh fleſh his arme, whoſe heart departeth from the Lord:</hi> What is the curſe? <hi>ver.</hi> 7. <hi>He ſhall be like the hearth in the deſart, he ſhall not ſee good when it commeth, he ſhall inhabit the parched places in the wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Note, The curſe conſiſts in two parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars.</p>
            <p n="1">1 <hi>He ſhall be barren like the hearth in the deſarts:</hi> dry, empty, poore, nothing of God in him, O this is it that is the cauſe men grow ſo barren, dry, empty, becauſe they reſt upon man, they durſt not entertain thoughts of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing farther then they conceive the Magiſtrate intends, miniſters admire, why ſo many gracious people leave them, they ſee they are

            <p>A ſecond curſe is, <hi>They ſhall not ſee when good commeth,</hi> this is the reaſon why ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, choice lerned men ſee not that good which is comming that truth, that grace, that glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, that God lets ſhine through the Goſpel) into the ſoules of many of his people, but they oppoſe it and perſecute it, the curſe of God being upon them, blinding them becauſe they truſt upon man, and make fleſh their arme, and their ſtrong confidence, and had rather deny truth, then ſuffer affliction with the people of God: but bleſſed is the man that truſteth in the Lord, &amp; whoſe hope is the Lord, <hi>ver.</hi> 7. <hi>He ſhall be fruitfull as a tree planted by the rivers of water, &amp;c.</hi> O take heed of receiving, or (at leaſt) of reſolving to receive rules from man in matter of worſhip,

If ever men ſhould again, as I truſt it ſhall not be, but I ſay, if it ſhould be ſo, that men ſhould as thoſe <hi>Mat.</hi> 15.9, teach for do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines the traditions of men, yet that you would not receive thoſe traditions for your Scripture, for in ſo doing you can doe no leſſe then incur that curſe of being made <hi>like unto a barren hearth in the wilderneſſe, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The third thing propounded concerning Chriſt as he is a Prophet, is the manner how he teacheth his people now he is in heaven, and that is, 1 <hi>Miniſterially,</hi> 2 <hi>Spiritually,</hi> 3 <hi>Powerfully.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1 <hi>Miniſterially,</hi> by his Miniſters, yet ever according to the rule, <hi>viz,</hi> the Scriptures thus Chriſt when he aſcended to heaven, ſent forth his Diſciples, <hi>Mat.</hi> 28.19, 20. and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed <hi>to be with them to the end of the world,</hi> and you ſhall ever finde Chriſt teaching by this means, <hi>Act.</hi> 2. <hi>Peter</hi> preaches, the Jews are converted, <hi>Chap.</hi> 5. and ſo the 8.12, <hi>Philip</hi> preaches the things concerning Jeſus, and they believed, and in the churches Chriſt, hath appointed Miniſters with their gifts, ſed <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4.11. and all <hi>for the edifying of the body of Chriſt,</hi> ſo that this is the firſt means by
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:119599:66"/>which he teaches, Rom. 10.14, 17. <hi>How then ſhall they</hi> call on him <hi>on whom they have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved? How ſhall they believe on him, of whom they have not heard? How ſhall they learn without a Preacher?</hi> ver. 17. <hi>Faith com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth by hearing, &amp;c.</hi> 1 Cor. 5.19, <hi>He hath put in us the word of reconciliation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2 Chriſt teacheth <hi>Spiritually,</hi> The Word and the Spirit goe both together: the word is but a dead letter in it ſelfe, farther then the Spirit goes along with it, therefore <hi>Joh.</hi> 6.36. <hi>It is the Spirit that quickneth, the fleſh profit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth nothing, the words that I ſpeak are Spirit and life,</hi> but if the ſpirit goes with the word, then the word proves Spirit and life: the Spirit worketh freely in the preaching of the Goſpel, the word is but an inſtrument in the hand of the Spirit, by which it works, ſee <hi>Iohn</hi> 3.8. <hi>The winde bloweth where it liſteth, ſo is every one that is borne of the Spirit:</hi> ſo it is the Spirit that worketh in the word, and by the word.</p>
            <p n="3">3 He teacheth <hi>powerfully,</hi> where Chriſt comes he teacheth powerfully, therefore the Goſpel is called, <hi>The power of God unto ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> Rom. 1.16. For <hi>I am not aſhamed of the Goſpel of Chriſt, it is the power, of God to ſalvation, to every one that believes,</hi> 1 Theſ. 1.3.
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:119599:67"/>
               <hi>For our Goſpel came not to you in word onely, but in power and in much, aſſurance, &amp;c.</hi> So that the Goſpel, it is the power of God you ſee: that it is that, wherein Chriſt manifeſts his power in teaching poor ignorant, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowing creatures, therefore it is ſaid, <hi>Mat.</hi> 7.29. that <hi>He taught them as one having au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, and not as the Scribes,</hi> that is, his Word had a commanding power and autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity over their ſpirits: beloved, if Chriſt once comes to teach your ſpirits, he will come with power, with authority, he will make a ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration between thy ſoul and thy ſins, he will pluck thee off from thy baſe luſts and curſed practiſes, as once he did <hi>Saul,</hi> Chriſt came with power and great authority upon him, and took him off from his perſecution, and makes him a preacher of that truth which before he perſecuted, and ſo will Chriſt deal with thy ſoule, whoever thou art that clea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſt as cloſe to thy ſins, as thy skin to thy fleſh, he will fetch thee off from it, if thou be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long unto him.</p>
            <p>The fourth particular propounded, was the <hi>matter,</hi> which Chriſt our Prophet teacheth.</p>
            <p>Firſt, he teacheth man to know himſelfe, for it is <hi>life eternall to know God and Jeſus
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:119599:67"/>Chriſt, John</hi> 17.3. and therefore you ſhall e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver finde men (in Scripture) appointed by Chriſt for the work of the miniſtry, to preach the Goſpel, (that is) a crucified Chriſt, <hi>Peter, Act.</hi> 2.36, 37. preacheth Chriſt crucified, brings them to know that it wa Chriſt indeed whom they had crucified: ſo <hi>Philip, Act.</hi> 8.12. preacheth the truth <hi>that concerne the Kingdom of God, and the name of Ieſus:</hi> So <hi>Paul,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.3. preached <hi>that Chriſt dyed for ſin according to the Scripture:</hi> this is the firſt thing to be preached, <hi>Chriſt and glad ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings by him:</hi> and therefore ſurely this is the firſt thing, that Chriſt effectually teacheth where he comes.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> Muſt men be taught the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edge of Chriſt before they know their own miſery, by reaſon of ſin? ſurely no man will accept of Chriſt unleſſe they ſee a need of him.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> It is the ſight and knowledge of Chriſt, that brings men truly to ſee, and know themſelves. <hi>Saul Acts</hi> 9. thought himſelfe a very holy and happy man, till he met Chriſt on the way: and note, Chriſt teaches him in the firſt place the knowledge of himſelf; <hi>Who art the Lord</hi> (ſayth <hi>Saul</hi>) <hi>I am Jeſus of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caroth</hi> (ſayth Chriſt) <hi>whom thou perſecuteſt.</hi>
               <pb n="118" facs="tcp:119599:68"/>Chriſt did not tell him of his ſin; <hi>O thou <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">

               </gap> ſee 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.20. <hi>Where is the wiſe? where is the Scribe? &amp;c. Hath not God made fooliſh the wiſdom of this world?</hi> O take heed of reſting
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:119599:68"/>upon humane wiſdome, arts and ſciences, they are dangerous things, if the Lord pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent it not, for a malicious devill, and a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitfull heart, to deceive you withall.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Chriſt teacheth theſe whom hee teacheth, to know themſelves, and that as I have ſayd, by a reflecting back upon them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, from beholding of Chriſt. They come now to ſee themſelves curſed, loſt creatnres, and believe it, every one whom Chriſt effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually teacheth, hee teacheth them to know themſelves, to be poore, loſt and undonecrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures in themſelves. Thus Chriſt brings thoſe, <hi>Acts</hi> 2.37. from beholding of Chriſt, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold themſelves; and make them cry out, <hi>Men and brethren, what ſhall we do? &amp;c.</hi> and ſo <hi>Saul, Acts</hi> 9.5, 6. after hee had ſeen Ieſus; <hi>I am Jeſus whom thou perſecuteſt, &amp;c.</hi> and then hee ſees himſelfe a poore creature, and comes trembling, and aſtoniſhed, and ſayd, <hi>Lord, what wouldeſt thou have me doe?</hi> So if our Chriſt come, hee will make you ſee your ſelves ſinners, with a witneſſe: and this thou canſt never do ſavingly, unleſſe Chriſt teach thee: <hi>Saul</hi> could perſecute and think hee did well, till Chriſt meets him, and ſhews him his ſin, but hee could never ſee himſelfe a perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, till Chriſt taught him, <hi>Saul</hi> perfecutes,
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:119599:69"/>but he confeſſeth, <hi>he did it ignorantly, through unbelief,</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.13. So there are many that out of zeal, are perſecutors of Chriſt in his Saints; but they do it <hi>ignorantly,</hi> they are perſwaded, that it is their duty, and that they doe God ſervice in it, as Chriſt himſelfe) foretelleth, <hi>John</hi> 16.2. (but I dare ſay as <hi>Saul</hi> ſayd of himſelfe) it is through ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance, out of zeale; <hi>thinking they doe God good ſervice,</hi> that it is their duty ſo to doe. Did they know, that in ſo doing, they perſecute Chriſt, who indeed takes every wrong done to his, as to himſelfe, I dare ſay, they would not doe it: but it is the power of Chriſt that muſt come upon their ſpirits, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they can ſee it: O men can hardly believe it; tell ſuch a man that perſecutes and impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons the Saints, (as did <hi>Saul</hi>) that they perſecute Chriſt, they will not believe it; they will be ready to ſay, as <hi>Hazael,</hi> 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 8.13. when the Prophet <hi>Eliſha</hi> tels him, what great wickedneſſe he ſhould commit, <hi>verſ.</hi> 12 <hi>What am I a dog? that I ſhould do this great thing?</hi> ſo many men who are bitter enemies to the Saints, ready to do any miſchiefe unto them, yet cannot be perfwaded, that they are the men, that perſecute Chriſt; <hi>What I ſuch a dog, to perſecute Chriſt?</hi> God forbid, yet can, and will perſecute the Saints. Beloved, conſider of
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:119599:69"/>it; Chriſt takes any wrong done to them, as done to himſelf, <hi>Acts</hi> 9.4. <hi>Why perſecuteſt thou Me?</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3 Where Chriſt comes in power, he teaches men <hi>to believe:</hi> this he taught when he was upon the earth, <hi>John</hi> 6.29. <hi>This is the work of God that they believe on him whom he hath ſent:</hi> and <hi>verſe</hi> 47. <hi>Verily, verily, he that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieveth on me, hath everlaſting life, Chap.</hi> 3.18 <hi>He that believeth on him, is not condemned,</hi> and <hi>verſe</hi> 36. <hi>He that believeth on the Son, hath everlaſting life, &amp;c.</hi> And this was it hee gave in commiſſion to his Diſciples to preach, <hi>Mar.</hi> 16.16, 17. <hi>To preach the Gospell to every creature; he that believeth and is baptized, ſhall be ſaved,</hi> and this <hi>Paul</hi> preached, <hi>Acts</hi> 16.31. <hi>Believe in the Lord Ieſus, and you ſhall be ſaved &amp;c.</hi> and this Chriſt doth not onely teach to the care, but to the heart alſo where he comes in power: this he taught his Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, <hi>Mat.</hi> 16.16. and <hi>Iohn</hi> 6.69. <hi>We believe and are ſure, that thou art Chriſt, the Son of the living God.</hi> And this hee taught all that ever came to him effectually, <hi>Acts</hi> 2.41. <hi>All that gladly received the word,</hi> that is the truth held forth in the word, the glad tydings of life by Chriſt preached in the Goſpel, and this is the <hi>work of Chriſt,</hi> Heb. 12.2. <hi>the gift of Chriſt,</hi> Epheſ. 2.8.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="122" facs="tcp:119599:70"/>
               <hi>Queſt.</hi> What is that Goſpel faith Chriſt teacheth to his people?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ. It is a believing of that record God hath given concerning his Son, with a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pending upon him for Iuſtification and Life.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1 <hi>It is a believing of the report God hath given concerning his Son:</hi> that is, that he is the Son of God, <hi>Mat.</hi> 3.17. the ſon of man, God and man, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.3, 4. <hi>Col.</hi> 2.9. <hi>That he is a mighty God, the everlaſting Father, the prince of peace,</hi> Eſay 9.6. <hi>That he came into the world to ſave ſinners,</hi> 1 Tim. 1.15. <hi>To ſave them from their ſins,</hi> Mat. 1.23. <hi>and from all their enemies,</hi> Luke 1.71. This is the record God hath in Scripture given, concerning his Son, and faith is required to believe it, <hi>John</hi> 5.10. <hi>He that believeth on the Son of God hath the witneſſe in himſelfe, he that believeth not God, hath made him a lyar, becauſe he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved not the record God gave of his Son,</hi> that is, to believe that he is the <hi>Chriſt</hi> the <hi>Auointed</hi> ſent of God, and fitted for the work to ſave ſinners, <hi>ver.</hi> 1. with <hi>ver.</hi> 11. <hi>This is the record that God hath given to us eternall life, and this life is in his Son.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2 Faith is a dependancie upon this Chriſt for life, flowing from a ſenſible apprehending
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:119599:70"/>of all that fulneſſe that is in him, <hi>John</hi> 6.68. When many Diſciples went from Chriſt, Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus ſaid to the twelve, <hi>Will yee alſo goe away?</hi> Simon Peter <hi>anſwered and ſaid, Lord, to to whom ſhall we goe? thou haſt the words of eternall life: we believe, and are ſure, that thou art the Chriſt, the Son of the living God,</hi> marke here is the Apoſtles faith, <hi>We believe thou art the Chriſt, thou haſt the words of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall life,</hi> therefore, whether ſhall we goe but to thee? If all forſake thee yet we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not, whether ſhall we goe? Here is faith, when a ſoule believes indeed Jeſus to be the Chriſt, the Sonne of the living God, and there leaves it ſelfe, ſees no way or means elſe in the world of help, but ſticks cloſe to the Lord Jeſus in a way of dependancie: and this none can doe, but by the power of God, ſee <hi>Mat.</hi> 16.17. <hi>Jeſus anſwered and ſaid unto him, bleſſed art thou</hi> Simon, <hi>fleſh and bloud hath not revealed it unto thee, but my Father which is in heaven, and none can call Ieſus the Lord but by the Holy Spirit, &amp;c.</hi> 1 Cor. 12.3.</p>
            <p>Now the fruit of this faith is <hi>Obedience,</hi> where ever Chriſt works this faith, it produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth obedience, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.5. <hi>By whem we have received Grace and Apoſtleſhip, to the obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of faith,</hi> ſo is the word in the Greeke.
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:119599:71"/>Faith is a working grace, it is not idle where it is, it worketh by love, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.6. <hi>Circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion availeth not, nor uncircumciſion but faith which worketh by love,</hi> Chriſt is ever teaching a believer, and hee receives this teaching, <hi>by faith which worketh by love,</hi> and conſtraineth the ſoule in whom it is, to ſubmit unto the teachings of Chriſt, which ſtill is according to Scripture, as you have heard.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Queſt.</hi> What doth Chriſt teach a believer after he hath given him faith?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> Chriſt teacheth many things to his Diſciples which they receive by faith, and they may be called (in ſome ſort) the fruits of faith, becauſe by faith we receive them, and ſubmit unto them, but they are indeed the fruits of the ſpirit, which Chriſt our Prophet giveth to his people, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.27. but I ſhall confine my ſelfe in the diſcovery of the teachings of Chriſt to the Saints under three heads: The firſt is <hi>Selfe denyall,</hi> 2 <hi>Univerſall obedience,</hi> 3 <hi>To live by faith.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The firſt is, <hi>ſelf-denyall,</hi> and this Chriſt teacheth in the firſt place where he comes, (I mean) to a believer, for ſelf-denyall is a fruit of faith: how can a man deny himſelfe till hee ſees ſomthing out of himſelfe wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:119599:71"/>thy of his love? See Chriſt teaching this leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon <hi>Luk.</hi> 9.23. <hi>If any man will be my Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, let him deny himſelf, and take up the croſſe and follow me.</hi> Chriſt teacheth his Diſciples to deny whatſoever is of <hi>fleſh,</hi> in the creature: Now there are ten things in <hi>ſelfe,</hi> which Chriſt teacheth his in ſome meaſure to deny, and to lay all down at his feet.</p>
            <p>There is, 1 <hi>Selfe ſinfull.</hi> 2 <hi>Selfe righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous.</hi> 3 <hi>Selfe wiſdome.</hi> 4 <hi>Selfe glorying,</hi> and <hi>boaſting.</hi> 5 <hi>Selfe profit.</hi> 6 <hi>Selfe pleaſure.</hi> 7 <hi>Selfe love.</hi> 8 <hi>Selfe will.</hi> 9 <hi>Selfe ſtrength &amp; Selfe ſufficiencie.</hi> 10 <hi>Selfe ends.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Firſt, <hi>Self ſinfull,</hi> or <hi>ſinfull ſelf:</hi> now it is true, that it is in it ſelf all very ſinfull: whatſoever is of <hi>ſelf,</hi> is ſinfull. But for the more cleer opening of this grace of <hi>ſelf-deny-all,</hi> I branch it forth under theſe heads, the firſt is <hi>Sinfull ſelf,</hi> where Chriſt is, hee tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth men thus to deny themſelves: they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſin willingly, ſee 1 <hi>John</hi> 3.9. <hi>Whoſoever is born of God, doth not commit ſin, for his ſeed remayneth in him, and he cannot ſin,</hi> that is, he cannot ſin with a mind to ſin: he denies his ſin, he loves not his ſin, therefore he is able to ſay, <hi>It is no more I, that do it, but ſin that dwelleth in me,</hi> as the Apoſtle, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.17. and
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:119599:72"/>therefore he is ever at enmity with his ſin, and luſts; the grace of God teaching him to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny them: <hi>Titus</hi> 2.11, 12. <hi>For the grace of God that bringeth ſalvation to all men, hath appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, teaching us, that denying ungodlines, and worldly lusts, we ſhould live ſoberly, and righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſly, and godly, in this preſent world.</hi> The grace of God manifeſted in the Goſpell, tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth men that rightly receive it, to deny themſelves, to deny all ungodlines, and world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly luſts: believe it, this is the grace of the Goſpel, it is not as ſome pretend, a Goſpell of liberty, to ſin, but ſuch grace as teacheth men to deny ſin, who-ever he be that takes liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in ſin, under a pretence of grace, certainly, it is not that grace that brings ſalvation, that teacheth men to deny ungodlineſſe and ſinfull luſts, that teacheth them to live ſoberly in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of themſelves, righteouſly towards men, and godlily towards God.</p>
            <p>This is the effect of the grace of the Goſpels <hi>Saul</hi> a perſecutor, ſhall be ſo no more, <hi>Za<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheus</hi> an oppreſſor ſhall be ſo no more: it makes a ſeparation between a man and his luſts, and between man and his ſinfull cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, as Job. 40.4, 5. <hi>Behold I am vile, and what ſhall I anſwer the? I will lay my hands upon my mouth, once have I ſpoken, but I will
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:119599:72"/>not anſwer, yea twice, but I will proceed no farther.</hi> So when once the grace of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel comes, then it makes a man lay down all ſin and luſt, whatever it be, as <hi>Saul, Acts</hi> 9.4, 5. once have I ſpoken, but I will proceed no farther, perhaps once I have been a perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutor; yea twice, but I will proceed no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: once I have been light, vain, prodigall, walked unbeſeeming the Goſpel of Chriſt, yea twice, but I will proceed no further: this grace teacheth men to deny ungodlineſſe.</p>
            <p n="2">2 There is <hi>righteous ſelfe,</hi> that is in ſelfe apprehenſion, though it is true, none can doe good, and the beſt actions out of Chriſt are but filthineſſe, yet ſuch a diſpoſition there is in nature, that is ever apt to have high thoughts of it ſelíe, they that know any thing know it.</p>
            <p>But when Chriſt commeth, he teacheth men to deny it, to caſt off all their own righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe as filthineſſe: ſee <hi>Paul,</hi> who was (indeed) full of ſelfe righteouſneſſe before his converſion (as himſelfe confeſſeth) <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.5, 6. <hi>He was circumeiſed the eighth day, of the ſtock of Iſrael, of the Tribe of</hi> Benjamin, <hi>an Hebrew of the Hebrews, and touching the Law a Phariſie, concerning zeale perſecuting the Church, touching the righteouſneſſe which
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:119599:73"/>is in the Law blameleſſe,</hi> here was a righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ſoule, who would think now this man ſhould have any need of a Chriſt? but fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low him a little, and ſee the change, all this muſt bee denyed, caſt off and rejected, as a thing of naught, as filthy polluted things, ſee <hi>ver.</hi> 7, 8, 9. <hi>But what things were gain to mee, thoſe I counted loſſe for Chriſt,</hi> that is, thoſe things that I once eſteemed gain, all that confidence that I had in the fleſh, I ſee they were all nothing, I was content to loſe them all for Chriſt, <hi>Yea doubtleſſe, and I account all things but loſſe for the excellencie of the knowledge of Chriſt Jeſus my Lord, for whom I have ſuffered the loſſe of all things</hi> (that is, all that was mine own) <hi>and doe count them dung that I may win Chriſt.</hi> Beloved, here is ſelfe-denyall in a wonderfull meaſure, to account all your own righteouſneſſe but as dung or filthineſſe, that you may win Chriſt, <hi>and be found in him, not having mine own righteouſneſſe which is of the Law</hi> (the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle exclaims that, caſts it away) <hi>but that which is through the faith of Chriſt, the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe which is of God by faith:</hi> here is a denying of <hi>righteous ſelfe,</hi> a rejecting of all his own righteouſneſſe as nothing nay, as very filthineſſe, and believe it, where Chriſt
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:119599:73"/>comes in ſome meaſure, he teacheth this leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. I confeſſe, this is a very hard leſſon, fleſh and bloud cannot attain it: herein lies the great myſtery of the Goſpel, which ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears to fleſh and bloud to be the greateſt folly: for a man to deny himſelfe, his du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles, prayers, beſt actions, caſt them down at the feet of Chriſt, as dung and droſſe. O it is a hard leſſon, yet ſuch a leſſon as the Saints muſt learn, yea, and doe learn it, in ſome meaſure from Chriſt: See <hi>Mat.</hi> 25.37. <hi>The righteous ſhall ſay, Lord, when ſaw we thee hungry, and fed thee? or thirſty, and gave thee drink.</hi> Note it, the Saints diſ-own all that ever they have done, they take no no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of it, they doe not remember it. It was not that whereon they built their conſolation: they looked to the righteouſneſſe of Chriſt and there they lay their ſalvation: And note again, Chriſt remembers the good works of the Saints, when they doe not remember it themſelves. O it is a ſweet thing to be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove theſe things, then Chriſt will remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber them: but when men live upon theſe things, and come to remember duties as a ground of comfort, then Chriſt will not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member them, ſee <hi>Mat.</hi> 22.23. <hi>Chriſt will profeſſe, I never knew you.</hi> Now the want
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:119599:74"/>of this grace in this particular, it occaſions two evils, the firſt and beſt of them is, and that even to the Saints, it deprives them of much comfort and ſpirituall peace: the poore ſoule looking upon its duties, ſeeing the weakneſſe, the imperfection of them, hee is troubled and complains, and doubts and queſtions its condition, and all for want of ſelfe denyall, that is not looking for any thing in thoſe duties. I dare ſay that the Saints duties kils them in their own apprehenſions more then any other of their ſins: but if the Lord help you to deny your ſelves, that is, not to expect any thing in duty, but lay it down at the feet of Chriſt, and to live upon Chriſt your All in all, you ſhall finde abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of influence of grace, and new mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtations of love, and in your duties you ſhall have more fellowſhip and communion with God, then ever: it is your expectation of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort in your own righteouſneſſe that deprives you of it: and juſt it is that it ſhould be ſo, nay, it is a mercie that it is ſo, for if God ſhould give thee thy deſire in duties, thou wouldeſt then live upon them, and undoe thy ſelfe for ever.</p>
            <p>The ſecond evill that flows from hence is, that men doe indeed deſtroy themſelves by
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:119599:74"/>this means: that is, it is an inſtrumentall means by which they deſtroy themſelves, as all men are deſtroyed by ſome means, and that is ſin: and by this ſinne, ſelfe righteous, men deſtroy themſelves: men living and dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, truſting upon their duties deſtroy them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves: and this is that which makes men ſpiritually proud, lifts up men when they have leaſt cauſe, when they live upon their own righteouſneſſe: But Chriſt teacheth his to deny themſelves.</p>
            <p n="3">3 There is <hi>ſelfe wiſdom</hi> in every man and woman naturally, and this Chriſt teacheth his to deny all, men are naturally too wiſe for Chriſt, ſo were the Grecians, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.22. <hi>The Greeks ſeeke after wiſdome,</hi> There is a great deale of carnall earthly wiſdome, that naturally dwels in men, and this wiſdome is enmity againſt God, and Gods wiſdome ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears fooliſhneſſe unto it, ſee what the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle ſayth, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.18. <hi>If any man among you ſeemeth to be wiſe, let him become a fool that he may be wiſe, for the wiſdome of the world is faoliſhneſſe with God.</hi> Here is an exhortation for a Church to take heed of ſelfe-wiſdome: you and I have need to learn this wiſdome, the Lord help us in it, to ſee our ſelves fools: ſee who is the right foole, <hi>Prov.</hi> 28.26. <hi>Who
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:119599:75"/>ſo truſteth in his own heart is a fool.</hi> The readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt way to attain wiſdome, is to lay all our own wiſdom down at the feet of Chriſt: the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> had boundance of humane wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome and learning, yet he abaſes himſelfe, he accounts all, not onely his righteouſneſſe, but wiſdome alſo, <hi>but dung and droſſe, all loſſe in compariſon of the excellencie af the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of Chriſt Jeſus.</hi> This is true wiſdom in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, truly to know God in Chriſt: this is that wiſdome which is from above, that brings life eternall with it, <hi>John</hi> 17.3. I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech you conſider of it, hath Chriſt taught your ſouls this leſſon? is your wiſdome hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven-borne wiſdome? or is it earthly? is it your own wiſdome? <hi>I am.</hi> 3.13, 14 15. <hi>Who is a wiſe man, and indued with knowledge amongſt you? let him ſhew out of a good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation his works with meekneſſe of wiſdom, but if yee have bitter envying and ſtrife in your hearts, glorie not, ly not againſt the truth, this wiſdome deſcendeth from above,</hi> but ſee <hi>ver.</hi> 19. <hi>The wiſdome that is from above, it is firſt pure, peaceable, gentle, eaſie to be intrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, full of-mercie and good fruits:</hi> it is all heavenly, like him whoſe it is: but mans wiſdome is all <hi>earthly, ſinfull, and deviliſh:</hi> which Chiſt teacheth his in ſome meaſure to deny.</p>
            <p n="4">
               <pb n="133" facs="tcp:119599:75"/>
4 There is naturally in every man. <hi>ſelfe boaſting.</hi> and <hi>ſelfe glorying</hi> in the creatures own wiſdome, and apprehended ſelfe excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencie: but where Chriſt teaches, he gives power againſt this curſed fruit of the fleſh, in ſome meaſure there is a diſpoſition of nature even in the Saints, to be exalted, and that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove meaſure, not onely in their own perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall excellencie, but in thoſe graces received from Chriſt. The Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> was ſenſible of both, in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9.27. where the Apoſtle ſayth, <hi>he beats down his body, &amp;c.</hi> There was a lifting up &amp; the Apoſtle was ſenſible of it: he found that in him that which was enough (had not God let him ſee it, &amp; helped him in it, as he apprehended, notwithſtanding his preaching to others) to make him a caſt away, ſo alſo, a <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.7. <hi>Leaſt I ſhould be exalted above meaſure, through the abundance of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velations, the Lord ſent me a prick in the fleſh, the meſſenger of Satan to buffet me:</hi> that was to pull him down, that he might not be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alted in himſelfe: there is in every childe of God a naturall diſpoſition to ſpirituall pride, he that knows any thing knows it: The Lord teach you and I to ſearch our own hearts in this particular, and give us power againſt it, ſee 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.1. <hi>Having ſuch promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:119599:76"/>let us cleanſe our ſelves from all filthineſſe of fleſh and ſpirit, &amp;c.</hi> This is the filthineſſe of ſpirit that the Saints are lyable unto: truly we have little cauſe to glory in any thing, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept in Chriſt Jeſus: <hi>What haſt thou</hi> (ſayth the Apoſtle) <hi>that thou haſt not received? and if thou haſt received it, why doſt thou yet boaſt?</hi> 1 Cor. 4.7. therefore (the Prophet ſayth) <hi>Let not the wiſe man glory in his wiſdome, nor the ſtrong man in his ſtrength, but let him that gloryeth glory in this, that he underſtandeth and knoweth the Lord.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is the exhortation of Chriſt to his Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, <hi>Luk.</hi> 10.20. <hi>Rejoyce not that the Devils are made ſubject to you, but rejoyce rather that your nanaes are written in heaven:</hi> and this leſſon, the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> learned, and every Chriſtian in ſome meaſure muſt learn, <hi>Gal.</hi> 6.14. <hi>God forbid that I ſhould glory in any thing, ſave in the croſſe of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt, by whom the world is crucified unto me, and I unto the world.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="5">5 There is <hi>ſelfe profit,</hi> which every man naturally is apt to looke after. O how hard is it for a poore creature to deny himſelfe? <hi>How hard is it for a rich man</hi> (ſayth Chriſt) <hi>to enter into the Kingdom of heaven?</hi> The world is a common baite, wherewith the
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:119599:76"/>Devill inticeth man to ſin, as <hi>Iudas, Ananias</hi> and <hi>Saphyra Act.</hi> 5. Nay, Chriſt lumſelfe is ſet upon with this temptation, <hi>Mat.</hi> 4. O this profit, the love of money, is the root of all evill.</p>
            <p>But where Chriſt comes teaching effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, he teacheth the ſoule to deny it ſelfe, to look upon the world as a very empty thing: he gives power to overcome the world, <hi>Who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever is borne of God over commeth the world, and this is the victory that over commeth the world, even our faith</hi> 1 <hi>Ioh.</hi> 5.4. Now the ſoule ſees that it is his duty, not to looke <hi>onely on his own things, but every one on the things of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother,</hi> Phil. 2.4. Now hee hath learned to ſympathize with the body, &amp; every member, he looks not upon himſelfe at a diſtance from the meaneſt member, making himſelfe equall to them of the lower ſort.</p>
            <p n="6">6 There is <hi>ſelf. pleaſure</hi> alſo, and this of two ſorts.</p>
            <p n="1">1 In delighting in pleaſures, of theſe the Apoſtle ſpeaks of, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.4. <hi>They ſhall be lovers of pleaſure, more then lovers of God:</hi> Beloved, it is much unbeſeeming Chriſtians to be lovers of pleaſure, ſee 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5.6. <hi>But ſhee that liveth in pleaſure, or ſhee that liveth delicately, is dead while ſhee liveth.</hi> Now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved,
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:119599:77"/>Chriſt takes off his people from theſe pleaſures, by preſenting better pleaſures to them, he makes them <hi>drinke of the river of his pleaſures, Pſalme</hi> 36.8. ſo that the Saints are not without pleaſures ſpirituall, and that abundantly and eternally, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 16.11. <hi>At his right hand are pleaſures for ever more:</hi> But God takes off his from thoſe earthly, carnall pleaſnres, which is indeed dangerous and deſtructive, <hi>Prov.</hi> 21.17. Hee that loveth pleaſure, ſhall be a poore man: it is true ſpiritually as well as temporally: carnall carthly pleaſures and profits, are two great enemies to the power and being of god. lineſſe, <hi>Luk.</hi> 8.14. cares, and riches, and pleaſures is that which choaketh the Word, that men bring forth no fruite to perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</p>
            <p>A ſecond ſort of Self-pleaſure is, when men reſolve to pleaſe themſelves O ſad word! that men ſhould have ſuch a diſpoſition to pleaſe themſelves: but where Chriſt teacheth, hee teacheth men in this caſe to deny them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.</p>
            <p>Now this may be conſidered under a two<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold relation eyther to God or our brethren.</p>
            <p n="1">1 <hi>To God,</hi> where Chriſt teacheth effectual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, there the ſoule will rather deny it ſelfe then
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:119599:77"/>God. It will rather pleaſe God then it ſelfe: Chriſt, who is the Saints pattern, did, always ſo walk as to pleaſe God. John 8.29. <hi>For I do always thoſe things that pleaſe him,</hi> to wit, the Father. Now Chriſt as hee was man in our fleſh, pleaſing the Father alwayes in all things, and ſo was our pattern; ſo he teacheth his the ſame leſſon. This is a Maxime in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, <hi>That whoſoever chuſeth to pleaſe him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, rather then God, Chriſt hath not taught him.</hi> 1 Theſ. 4.1. <hi>We beſeech you, brethren, and exhort you by the Lord Ieſus, that, as ye have received of us, how yeought to walk and pleaſe God, ſo ye would abound more and more.</hi> As if the Apoſtle had ſayd, that which ye have received of us is, that ye ought to walke ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the example of Chriſt, to pleaſe God. This is the doctrine, that wee have taught you, we beſeech and exhort you by the Lord Jeſus, <hi>That ye abound more and more in this grace.</hi> This is an excellent choice grace, to pleaſe the Lord: ever to have that in thine eye to pleaſe God, though thou diſpleaſe thy ſelfe, that is, thy fleſhly carnall ſelfe, <hi>Col.</hi> 1.10. O this is a ſoule taught indeed by the ſpirit of God, when he prefers the pleaſing of the Lord before himſelf, or carnall friends, or any thing: ſee Prov. 16.7. <hi>When a man ways pleaſe the
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:119599:78"/>Lord, hee maketh, even his enemies to be at peace with him:</hi> when a man ſeeks to pleaſe God, in walking anſwerable to the rule of God, though hee diſpleaſe his enemies, God will make thoſe enemies to be at peace with him.</p>
            <p n="1">1 This being rightly learned, is that which would carry you along through all op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions in a way of truth: perhaps ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>things, yea, ſome truths, may ſeeme hard to a poore creature to be ſubmitted unto; per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps the poore creature reſolving with fleſh and bloud, which will have its bouts even in the Saints, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.21. may be ready to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude ſometimes, if I ſubmit to this way, to this truth, I muſt expect reproach, perſecution, perhaps loſſe of liberty, eſtate, yea, life and all: now it would wonderfully pleaſe carnall reaſon to deny ſuch a truth, to hide and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal ſuch a truth in unrighteouſneſs: but when a ſoule comes to this; it is my duty to pleaſe God; therefore hath Chriſt required it: will it pleaſe the Lord Jeſus? O then I dare not but doe it: come what will, I cannot but doe it, truly you who indeed love the Lord Jeſus, that Love will conſtrain you to pleaſe him, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though you diſpleaſe your ſelves.</p>
            <p>But ſecondly, thoſe who are taught of God
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:119599:78"/>will rather diſpleaſe themſelves, then diſpleaſe their brethren, the Saints. This is a neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary leſſon, a gracious ſoule will diſpleaſe him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf rather then the Saints: this is a leſſon, that both you and I, have need to learn; and I doubt wee come ſhott in our practice of it. I ſpeak not eyther to blame or ſhame any of you, I have more againſt my ſelfe in this par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular then againſt you all: but I ſpeake to informe, to forewarn both my ſelf, and you in this particular: but to prevent any miſtake or miſunderſtanding of what I ſhall ſpeake concerning this thing, I deſire, before I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed, to let you to know, that I do not intend that you ſhould be men-pleaſers, that is, that ye ſhould ſo pleaſe one the other, as to ſuffer any ſin in each other, without reproofe, or admonition in love; therein you come to hate one the other. Neyther be ye externally in ſhew only ſuch, for the Apoſtle reproves ſuch, ſpeaking of the duty of ſervants, Epheſ. 6.6. <hi>Not with eye ſervice as men-pleaſers: but ſo pleaſing the Saints, as in that you pleaſe God,</hi> 2 Theſ. 2.4. <hi>So ſpeake we as not pleaſing men, but God.</hi> See <hi>Gal.</hi> 1.10.</p>
            <p>But to proceed, it is the duty of the Saints ſo far to pleaſe their brethren, as to deny themſelves, as the Apoſtle <hi>Paul,</hi> 1 Cor. 10.33
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:119599:79"/>
               <hi>Even as I pleaſe all men in all things; not ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king mine own profit, but the profit of many, that they may be ſaved:</hi> the Apoſtle ſeeks to pleaſe all men, that hee might winne ſome to the Goſpell, which is every Saints duty: much more then to pleaſe the Saints in love, rather then in every thing to ſeek to pleaſe our ſelves. It is this <hi>Self pleaſure</hi> that is the cauſe of ſo much diviſion amongſt the Saints. How hard a thing is it for one Saint to ſtoop to the weakneſſe of another? love would cauſe us to ſtoop to each other, and to performe every ſervice of love each to other, Rom. 15.2. <hi>Let every one of us pleaſe his neighbour, for his good to edification:</hi> And why? <hi>verſ.</hi> 3. <hi>For Chriſt pleaſed not himſelf, &amp;c.</hi> If your hearts and my heart, was not ſo moulded into this forme of doctrine, as that you could count it your joy to pleaſe you brethren, that you could chooſe rather to pleaſe a Saint, then to pleaſe your ſelves, and ſo every one to have this heart of love toward each other; what comforta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble life of love in the Lord might the Saints live? Whereas one the contrary, when every one ſtands off to pleaſe himſelf, men run an end, to have their own minds: what whiſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings? what bitterneſſe, will ariſe even in the Saints? nay, how doe they come ſometimes
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:119599:79"/>even to byte and devoure one the other, as the Apoſtle ſpeaks?</p>
            <p>But my beloved, I hope better things of you: I ſpeake not to condemne, but to fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warne, both my ſelfe and you of this great evill, which too much creeps in among the Saints: and to let you ſee a glimpſe of the amiableneſſe of that grace of love, which is ſo uſefull amongſt the Saints.</p>
            <p n="7">7 There is <hi>Self love</hi> naturally in every man: ſo the Apoſtle fore-tels, 2 Tim. 3.2. <hi>Men ſhall be lovers of their own ſelves</hi> and that Profeſſours too, and <hi>that in the laſt dayes.</hi> See Verſe 1. Now Chriſt who is the Saints Prophet, and Teacher, hee teacheth them to deny this ſelfe love: (not that a man may not, love himſelfe, love his ſoule, love to enjoy good. Prov. 19.8. <hi>He that getteth wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome loveth his own ſoule:</hi> So likewiſe, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.10. but that he ſhould not love himſelfe and himſelfe onely, this is ſinfull love, Chriſt Jeſus never taught this love; but a man may to love himſelfe, as that he love his brethren alſo; nay, he may ſo love himſelfe, as that he love his brethren as himſelfe, <hi>Rom.</hi> 13.9. <hi>Thou ſhalt love thy neighbour</hi> (to wit, thy brother) <hi>as thy ſelfe:</hi> This is the love Chriſt teacheth where he comes, and he doth not
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:119599:80"/>onely teach it in word, but in example alſo; be may be ſaid ſo far to deny himſelfe, as not to love himſelfe, in compariſon of that love manifeſted to us; he loved us better then he loved himſelfe; our life better then his own life; for he gave his own life freely, to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe life for our ſouls: here was great love, <hi>John</hi> 15.13. <hi>Greater love then this hath no man, that he lay down his life for his friends,</hi> and we ought to be followers of Chriſt in this grace of love, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 5.1, 2. <hi>Be yee followers of God, as dear children, and walke in love, even as Chriſt hath loved you, and given himſelfe for you.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="8">8 There is <hi>ſelfe will</hi> alſo, and this Chriſt teacheth the Saints to deny, and to ſubmit unto the will of God: this Chriſt our pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tern hath given us an example, <hi>who came not to doe his own will, but the will of him that ſent him: It is my meat and drinke to doe the will of my Father, Iohn</hi> 4.34. In his prayer before his ſuffering, <hi>Mat.</hi> 26.39. <hi>Not as I will, but as thou wilt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>O bleſſed example, to be imitated of all the Saints! What? Jeſus Chriſt deny himſelfe, his own will, and ſhall not the Saints doe it, his Diſciples and followers? But Chriſt hath not onely given us his example, as our
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:119599:80"/>pattern, but he hath exhorted us thereunto al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo, <hi>Mat.</hi> 7.21. <hi>Not he that ſayth Lord, Lord, ſhall enter into the Kingdome of heaven, but he that doth the will of my Father, &amp;c.

            <p>
               <hi>What is the cauſe of this warre and bloud but ſelf will? I mean next under God, one will eſtabliſh one Religion, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other will eſtabliſh another Religion: one will eſtabliſh Epiſcopall, another will eſtabliſh Presbyterian Government; or elſe the Kingdome muſt rue it: being ſtirred up thereunto on both ſides by the Clergie, and is likely to bring ruine upon the Kingdome, if God prevent it not; in teaching thoſe whom it concerns, that they have nothing to doe in either ſide, to compell men to any Religion: that it is the will of men, and never the will of Chriſt, to give his Kingdome and Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:119599:81"/>minion to the will of men, to the will of the Magiſtrate.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This <hi>ſelf will</hi> is that cauſeth ſtirs and trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles in families, the husband will have his mind, and the wife will have her minde: this cauſeth ſtirs in Churches amongſt the Saints, when every one will have his own mind: his own way, will pleaſe himſelf, whoever be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſed. O how ſweetly might the Saints live if the Lord teach them to deny themſelves?</p>
            <p n="9">9 Chriſt teacheth to deny <hi>Self ſufficiencie,</hi> and ſelfe ſtrength: there is a naturall diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the creature to think that it hath pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er in it ſelfe, to act to wards God: and thoſe that hold freewill, make it a part of their faith, that although in word, they ſeem to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny freewill, yet indeed they hold it; and that the creature acts of his owne ſtrength, and may fall from grace, or may ſtand if he will: but where Chriſt comes in power, he teaches men to deny this principle, John 15.5. <hi>With<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out me you can do nothing,</hi> and the Apoſtle, that had experience of the workings of God, conſeſſeth it, 1 Cor. 15.10. <hi>I laboured more then they all, yet not I, but the grace of God in me,</hi> and <hi>Phil.</hi> 2, 13. <hi>It is God that worketh in you both to will and to do of his good pleaſure.</hi>

            <p n="10">
               <pb n="145" facs="tcp:119599:81"/>
10 And laſtly, there are <hi>ſelf ends</hi> alſo: and theſe Chriſt teacheth his to deny. There is a naturall diſpoſition in the creature to ſeeke himſelfe and his own ends in every thing. <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.21. <hi>For all ſeeke their own, and not the things that are Jeſus Chriſts,</hi> therefore the Apoſtle exhorts the Corinthians, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.24. <hi>Let no man ſeeke his own, but ſeeke yee one anothers wealth:</hi> Chriſt teacheth his in ſome meaſure to lay downe all ſelf ends at his feet, and to ſeeke him and his honour, ſo that now what ever the Chriſtian doth, it is for Chriſt, if he preach it is Chriſt, and for Chriſt, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.5. <hi>We preach not our felves, but Chriſt Jeſus the Lord, and our ſelves your ſervants for Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus ſake:</hi> All that ever the Saints doe, they doe for the honour of Chriſt, 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 1.11. and why? they are not their own, <hi>they are bought with a price,</hi> therefore they are to glorifie God in their bodies and ſpirits, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.19, 20.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Queſt.</hi> May not a Chriſtian ſeeke him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe in any caſe? may he not ſeeke his own good?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> Is without queſtion a man may ſeeke his own good, but he may not ſeeke himſelfe. 1 He may not ſeeke himſelfe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, but firſt, the glory of God, and in
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:119599:82"/>ſeeking to glorifie God, he muſt of neceſſity ſeeke his own good, for God hath ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyn'd his glory, and the Saints good toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that it is impoſſible to glorifie the Lord, but the good of the Chriſtian muſt be inclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in it, for this is the Saints rule, <hi>doe all to the glory of God,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.31. this is the Saints priviledge <hi>All ſhall work together for good, to them that love God,</hi> Rom. 8.28.</p>
            <p>There are many baſe and ſelfe ends, that profeſſors may have in their actions, as thoſe <hi>John</hi> 6. that followed Chriſt for the loaves, more then for love to him: ſo it is poſſible that men may follow Chriſt for outward and by-ends, although I confeſſe I ſee but little ground, why men ſhall now turn Chriſtians for the world, for they are like to enjoy leaſt of it, as the Scribe that came to Chriſt, and would follow him whither ſoever he went, he thought to gain ſomthing by Chriſt, <hi>Mat.</hi> 8.20. but Chriſt tels him, that he was not like to gain what he expected: <hi>The foxes have holes, and the birds of the air have neſts, but the Sonne of man hath not where to reſt his head:</hi> and therefore he had no houſe of preferment for him. It was a good reſolution of the Scribe, had his end been as good to follow Chriſt whither ſoever he went: this
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:119599:82"/>is the noble reſolution indeed of every one that rightly comes to Chriſt, to follow him, whither ever he leads him: they follow him through good report, and bad report, through any tribulation, to the Kingdome of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.</p>
            <p>But thoſe that come to Chriſt in expectati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to gain the world, they are likely (for all that I know) to miſſe of their ends.</p>
            <p>Some come that they may get heaven, and ſo they pray, preach, doe all to get heaven by it, but they are like to miſſe of their end. <hi>Mat.</hi> 7.22. <hi>Luke</hi> 13.26.</p>
            <p>Some profeſſe that they may be counted Chriſtians amongſt others, as the Scribes and Phariſees, they did what they did to be ſeen of men, <hi>Mat.</hi> 23.5.</p>
            <p>But theſe are not the Saints ends in their duties, they ſeeke Jeſus of <hi>Natereth,</hi> a cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified Chriſt, and his glory, and therein they glory and rejoyce, <hi>Gal.</hi> 6.14.</p>
            <p>Thus you ſee when Chriſt teacheth effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, he teacheth men to deny themſelves, and ſindeed there is good reaſon for it, that it ſhould be ſo.</p>
            <p n="1">1 There is great reaſon that man ſhould deny his own righteouſneſſe, or elſe he is like never to partake of Chriſts righteouſneſſe:
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:119599:83"/>Chriſt will be the alone juſtifier, or elſone juſtifier, he will be all or none at all, <hi>Gal.</hi> 2.16, 21. <hi>Col.</hi> 3.11. Therefore the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> who once had as much ſelfe-righteouſneſſe as another man, he thought himſelfe once a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>live, but when Chriſt came, he taught him to lay down all that was his own at the feet of Chriſt, and to ſuffer the loſſe of all things, that ſeemed gain to him before, that he might win Chriſt, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.8.</p>
            <p n="2">2 There is a neceſſity for Chriſtians to deny ſinful-ſelfe: And that.</p>
            <p n="1">1 As they ſtand in relation to Chriſt, who is their juſtification, for is it the naturall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty of grace to ſubdue ſin, to purge forth iniquity, Chriſt dwels in every juſtified be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving ſoul, and where Chriſt dwels, there cannot be a love <hi>unto,</hi> and a delight <hi>in</hi> ſinne, 1 <hi>John</hi> 3.9. <hi>Whoſoever is borne of God, doth not commit ſin, for his ſeed remaineth in him, and he cannot ſin becauſe he is borne of God,</hi> he doth not ſin, becauſe his ſeed remaineth in him, that is, the ſpirit of grace and of Chriſt remaineth in him, that now he cannot ſinne, becauſe borne of God: that is, as he is a man born of grace, he cannot ſin, he cannot ſinwith a minde to ſin, with a delight in ſin, therefore the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> ſayth, <hi>Tit.</hi> 2.11, 12. <hi>The
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:119599:83"/>grace of God that brings ſalvation, teacheth men to deny ungodlineſſe and worldly luſts, and to live ſoberly, and righteouſly, and godly, in this preſent evill world:</hi> it is the proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of grace, to teach men to deny ungod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe.</p>
            <p n="2">2 There is great reaſon why it ſhould be thus: and that,</p>
            <p n="1">1 With relation to the great contrariety that is between Chriſt and ſin, Chriſt and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan, for all ſin is of the devil. 1 <hi>John</hi> 3.8. <hi>Hee that committeth ſin is of the devill,</hi> Chriſt and Satan, Chriſt and ſin, which is Satans work, are one of the effects of his work, are open adverſaries each to other, and ſin and Satan are abſolute rebels againſt Chriſt, ſo that they cannot poſſible dwell together in one and the ſame ſoule: that is the reaſon, Chriſt in the Saints is ever weakning and ſubduing ſin and Satan, he ever teacheth the Saints to deny ſin, it being ſo contrary to his holy and pure nature, they being made partakers of the ſame divine nature, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.4. their ſpirits are ever carryed forth againſt ſin.</p>
            <p n="2">2 The Saints cannot but deny ſin as they ſtand related to Chriſt, in relation to his glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, Chriſt is holy, and he will have a holy people, that may be for his praiſe and honour,
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:119599:84"/>1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.9. <hi>But yee are a choſen generation, a royall prieſthood, a holy Nation, a peculiar people,</hi> why? <hi>That yee ſhould ſhew forth the praiſes of him, who hath called you out of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe into his marvelous light.</hi> Chriſt hath made you and I holy, that ſo we might ſhew forth his praiſe, that is, that ſo we might give occaſion to praiſe God.</p>
            <p>Are not the eyes of the world upon the Saints, expecting much from them? although it is true, they doe not, nay, they cannot love holineſſe, yet they expect the Saints to be holy, and to deny ſin: are they not ready to watch opportunities to ſcandall Saints and truth withall, and would it not be a very ſad and grievous thing, if thoſe that profeſſe themſelves to be for Chriſt, ſhould give juſt cauſe of offence? would it not be very diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honourable to the name of the Goſpel and profeſſion of Chriſt,? therefore Chriſt teaches men and women where he comes to deny ungodlineſſe and ſin, and to live ſoberly, righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſly, and godly in this world. It is his exhortation, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.16. <hi>Let your light ſo ſhine before men, that they may ſee your good works, and glorifie your Father which is in heaven:</hi> Let your light ſhine before the men of the world, that they may have no cauſe to
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:119599:84"/>ſpeak evill, but rather cauſe to gloriſie God: Let your light ſo ſhine before the Saints that they may rejoyce and glorifie God. A cloſe walking with God is that which gives great cauſe of joy and rejoycing in each other, and an occaſion of prayſing God, one for another: ſo the Apoſtle, Rom. 1.8. <hi>I thank God through Jeſus Chriſt for you all, that your faith is ſpoken of through all the world:</hi> How was their faith ſpoken of? it was the fruit of their faith, their obedience in walking up with God, anſwerable to that faith they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed, for by our works we manifeſt our faith: ſo likewiſe, <hi>Phil.</hi> 1.3, 5. the Apoſtle thanks God for their conſtant fellowſhip in the Goſpel, from their firſt ſubmitting to it: This is a cauſe of joy. But on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, for ſuch as beare the name of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, to live in, and delight in ſin, to be vain, and carnall, and earthly, this is a cauſe of ſorrow and weeping, amongſt Saints. <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.18. <hi>For many walke, of whom I told you before, and now tell you weeping, they are enemies to the croſſe of Chriſt,</hi> they cauſe the croſſe of Chriſt, and the way of Chriſt to bee evill ſpoken of, a cauſe of ſadneſſe indeed to the Saints.</p>
            <p n="3">3 <hi>Reaſon,</hi> Why Chriſt teacheth his to
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:119599:85"/>deny ſelf wiſdome, ſelf love, ſelf will, and all of ſelf, is, becauſe they are to take up their croſſe and to follow Chriſt: that is, they muſt expect reproaches, afflictions, tribulations for the name and ſake of Chriſt. John 16.33. <hi>In the world you ſhall have tribulations.</hi> Now what wiſe man in the world, can or will ſuffer reproch, the loſſe of the world, and the worlds reputation, the loſſe of friends, liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, eaſe, it may be of life it ſelfe, in a word, all that is neer and deer to the carnall man? what man but a foole (thinks the wiſe men of the world) is there, that will loſe all on ſuch light terms, as the gaining of a crucified Chriſt.</p>
            <p>A man not taught of Jeſus, as the truth is in Jeſus, can never ſuffer with comfort and joy: theſe things the Saints are like to ſuffer for the name of Ieſus. Self wiſdom, and ſelf love, will come in: O ſayth wiſe ſelſe, when it eyes that perſecution, thoſe hardſhips, that are like to follow thoſe that follow Chriſt; <hi>May I not paſſe by ſuch atruth, and ſuch a practice, and it be a Chriſtian, and get to heaven? what need I to adventure my ſelfe upon ſuch hardſhips, when perhaps for the neglecting of ſuch, or ſuch an opinion or practice, I may attain my liberty, my good reputation?</hi> Is it not a ſad thing, that men profeſſing Chriſt, ſhould thus conſult with
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:119599:85"/>fleſh and bloud? the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> did not ſo, when hee was converted to the faith of Ieſus, <hi>hee conſulted not with fleſh and bloud. Gal.</hi> 1.16. It is ſelf wiſdom, and ſelf love, that ſets men to conſulting with fleſh and bloud: but <hi>fleſh and bloud cannot inherit the kingdom of God,</hi> 1 Cor. 15.50. That is a man not taught of Chriſt, not made partaker of his divine nature, and grace, bearing only the image of the earthly <hi>Adam,</hi> cannot enter into the Kingdome of Heaven.</p>
            <p>When a man ſhall come to ſubmit to Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpell Ordinances which are contemptible in the eyes of the world, for which hee is like to ſuffer ſhame and diſgrace, here is need of ſelf deniall. O ſayth the ſelf denying Chriſtian, <hi>Let mee ſubmit to Chriſt, to every truth; to every ordinance, although I ſuffer loſſe in the world, reproch, and ſhame from my friends, and acquaintance; though I looſe the love of my best friends;</hi> whether father, mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, husband, wife, &amp;c. yet ſayth the ſelf de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying Chriſtian, Chriſt hath ſayd, that <hi>who ſo loveth father, mother, wife, or children, more then me, is not worthy of me:</hi> and the love that CHRIST hath ſhed abroad in my heart by his Spirit, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.5. conſtraineth me to deny my ſelfe, and follow Chriſt in all
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:119599:86"/>conditions. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.14. Thus you ſee the ſelf. denying ſoul, and none elſe, is meet to be a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeiple, a follower of Chriſt: hee is ready to take up the croſſe daily and to follow him.</p>
            <p n="4">4 Chriſt teacheth his to deny ſelf ſufficien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, and ſelf ſtrength, that ſo they may be able to hold out in the evill day, when a day of adverſity comes, when a man is put to it, ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by his ſpiritual or temporal enemy, <hi>Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed are they then, that truſt in the Lord,</hi> Pſal. 2.12. Men ſtanding upon their own ſtrength are gone. Eſay 40.30. <hi>The youth ſhall faint, and be we ary, the young men ſhall utterly fail:</hi> that is, thoſe that apprehend a power in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to ſtand, but Verſe 31. <hi>They that wait upon the Lord, ſhall renew their ſtrength, they ſhall mount up with wings as Eagles, they ſhall run and not be weary, they ſhall walk and not faint.</hi> If men ſtand upon their own ſtrength, they are like to fall: <hi>Let him that thinketh he ſtandeth, take heed leſt he fall.</hi> But they that ſee an inſufficiency in themſelves, and <hi>truſt upon the name of the Lord, ſhall be as mount Sion that ſhall never be moved,</hi> Pſal. 125.1. <hi>but abideth for ever.</hi> Chriſt would have his work, to be a perfect and fair work: his covenant a ſure covenant, <hi>Eſay</hi> 55.3. Therefore hee un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertakes, not only to bring men and women
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:119599:86"/>intocovenant, but to keep them there, Ier. 32.40. <hi>I will not turn from them, they ſhall not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part from me,</hi> ſayth the Lord. But if Chriſt had left the power of ſtanding to man, hee might have been as likely to fall away as <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,</hi> nay, and more likely, for there is a body of ſin left ſtill in the Saints, matter for the Deuill to work upon; but <hi>Adam</hi> was with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſin, therefore there is no poſſibility for that man to ſtand, that ſtands upon his owne ſtrength. But it is in the ſtrength of Chriſt the believer ſtands; <hi>without me ye can do no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,</hi> Iohn 15.5. You cannot pray, or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form any duty acceptably, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.26. much leſſe ſtand and hold out to the end againſt all ſpirituall oppoſitions, a Chriſtian is to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter withall.</p>
            <p>The fifth and laſt reaſon why Chriſt teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth this grace of ſelf denyall to the Saints is, that ſo they might live in love and peace one with another. If every Saint ſhould ſeeke to pleaſe himſelf. and love himſelfe, and to have his own will in every thing; how is it poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble love and peace ſhould be continued a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the Saints, if there ſhould not be a bearing with, and forbearing one with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, if the ſtrong ſhould not beare the infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities of the weak, and not pleaſe themſelves?
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:119599:87"/>but God hath ſo tempered the body together, that they ſhould all ſeek the good of each other in love: that there ſhould be no Schiſm in the body, but that the members ſhould have the ſame care one of another, as of themſelves, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.25. that every one might ſecke, not their own, but one anothers good. That they might all grow up together a compleat body, a holy temple in the Lord.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Uſe.</hi> 1 A word of examination and tryall, hath Chriſt bin thy Prophet? hath he taught thee this leſſon of ſelf denyall? this is a very needfull uſe, not only for carnall men, but for Saints: it was the exhortation of the Apoſtle, 2 Cor. 13.5. <hi>Examine your ſelves, prove your ſelves, know you not, Chriſt is in you, except ye be reprobates.</hi> Chriſt is in every Saint; and if there, what doth he there? Surely hee is not there for nought, he will be ever teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſoul, hee will be there as they Prophet, ſhewing thee the way thou ſhalt walk in.</p>
            <p>Conſider a little now, I beſeech thee, hath Chriſt taught thee to deny thy owne righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe? canſt look upon it all as filthineſſe? or elſe art thou ſtuffed and filled with thine own righteouſneſſe, lifted up as high as the heavens in thine own conceit? like the proud Phariſee, <hi>I thank God I am not as bad as other
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:119599:87"/>men.</hi> I pray and performe duty, I have a good heart, and as good a mind to God as any man. If this be thy condition, the Lord Ieſus hath never been thy Prophet: thou art yet in the gall of bitterneſſe, and bond of iniquity: <hi>Thouſayſt thou art rich, and wanteſt nothing,</hi> when the truth is (if the Lord open thine eyes to ſee it) <hi>thou art poore and miſerable, and wretched, and blind, and naked.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Hath Chriſt taught thee to deny vngodlines and ſin? or elſe canſt thou take pleaſure in un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteouſneſſe? I dare ſay it, that ſome there are in the world, that have high thoughts of of themſelves, yet indeed, make a mocke of ſin, take pleaſure in unrighteouſneſſe: if this be thy condition, the Lord Chriſt hath never taught thy ſoule, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.9. Chriſt teacheth to be holy, and humble; hee gives power a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt ſin, and Iuſt, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.9.10, 11. Conſider you, who have been taught of God, hath hee taught your ſouls this leſſon, to deny your owne wiſdome, will, end, ſtrength, and all? to lay down all as nothing, at the feet of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus? The Lord help you and I a little now to examine our ſelves how much of ſelf yet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayns, ſelf wiſdome, ſelf glorying and boaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, ſelf love, ſelf ends: O how doth the Devill crowd in theſe things into the ſoules of the
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:119599:88"/>Saints, the Lord help you and I to ſee it, and give us power againſt it? certainly if it be with your ſouls, as it is with mee, you have ſome experience of theſe things: hardly can you performe any duty, but ſelf will preſent it ſelfe to your view in one ſhape or another. Now where Chriſt teaches he ever ſets the ſoule a work againſt thoſe ſins, and cauſes the ſoule ever to have high thoughts of it ſelfe, and to have high thoughts of God, and of the Saints, eſteeming every one better then himſelfe.</p>

            <p>Note this one word where God hath be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun this work in any meaſure, though you find much of ſelf, and it is thy burthen, yet here is a ground of comfort for ſuch a ſoule: it is mercy thou ſeeſt that evill of ſelf, that is in thee, and that it is thy burthen. The com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort is, 1 that Jeſus Chriſt hath beene thy Prophet: hee hath taught thee in ſome mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure to deny thy ſelfe, and given thee a deſire after the perfection of this grace. 2 That where Jeſus hath began this work he will fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh it, he will perfect it to the days of Chriſt. 8 Thou mayſt live upon him henceforth, and expect teachings from him; new manifeſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, new diſcoveries of grace and love, new influences of power from himſelf as thou ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſt in need for his own honour, the Saints good, or thine own conſolation, <hi>Heb.</hi> 13.5. Thus much for the firſt, which is Self-deniall.</p>
            <p n="2">2 Where Chriſt becomes a Prophet, hee eacheth that ſoule to yield <hi>univerſall obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nce</hi> to himſelfe: this is an effect of the tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching of Chriſt. <hi>Mat.</hi> 28.20. teaching them to obſerve and doe all things whatſoever I ſhall ſay unto you, and <hi>Acts</hi> 3.22, 23. <hi>A Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, ſhall the Lord your God raiſe up unto you,

2 Now this love is manifeſted, 1 To Chriſt. 2 To the Saints.</p>
            <p n="1">1 To Chriſt, and that, firſt in keeping his commandements, <hi>Joh.</hi> 14.23. <hi>Jeſus anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red and ſaid, If a man love me, he will keepe my words, ver.</hi> 24. <hi>he that loveth me not, keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not my ſayings.</hi> Love will cauſe thoſe in whom it is to ſubmit to Chriſt in every thing, 1 <hi>John</hi> 5.3. <hi>This is the love of God, that wee keep his commandements:</hi> that is, here in is our love to God, made manifeſt, in keeping his commandements.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Queſt.</hi> What are the commands of Chriſt to his children with relation to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> His command is firſt <hi>love</hi> as you have heard. 2 <hi>Obedience</hi> flowing from her: this obedience is firſt to Goſpel commands. 2 In a Goſpell manner. 3 To Goſpel ends. Firſt, it muſt be to Goſpell commands; wee are to heare Chriſt in all things, not <hi>Moſes:</hi> Act. 3.22. <hi>him ſhall you heare in all things, &amp;c.</hi> believers are to receive every comand as from the hands of Chriſt, John 15.14, <hi>Ye are my friends, if you doe whatſoever I command you.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The firſt command that Chriſt requires of believers, and that next after faith received,
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:119599:90"/>is Baptiſme, <hi>Mar.</hi> 16.17. <hi>He that believeth and is baptized ſhall be ſaved:</hi> ſo likewiſe, <hi>Mat.</hi> 28.19. Diſciple Nations, and baptize them: this was the firſt thing in the commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, to be ſubmitted to, and it was ever ſo in the Apoſtles practice, which muſt be our pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tern, <hi>Act.</hi> 2.41. <hi>As many as gladly received the Word</hi> (that is, believed the truth of the Goſpel, and gladly received the Lord Jeſus, the ſumme and ſubſtance of the Goſpel) <hi>were haptized,</hi> ſo <hi>Act.</hi> 8.12. <hi>They believed and were baptized, both men and women,</hi> ſo <hi>Act.</hi> 16. <hi>Lydia</hi> and the Goalar: In a word, this was the firſt duty that ever the Saints perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, the firſt ordinance that ever they ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed to after faith received: in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture there is neither precept nor preſident, either to baptize before faith, or after, to teach faith, or elſe after faith is received, to neglect or ſlight baptiſme, it being a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of Chriſt: love in the Saints compel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling them to yield obedience to every ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of Chriſt for his own ſake, with an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation of a farther diſcovery, and manife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtation of love and grace from God, in his own ordinance, in his own way.</p>
            <p>Now I confeſſe there are many objections that by many are made againſt this truth,
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:119599:90"/>who plead for, and practice the baptizing of inſants: But becauſe I have in another trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe indeavoured from the light of Scripture to cleare the truth and anſwer thoſe objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, I ſhall in this place paſſe them by, onely by reaſon of our late conference, I ſhall briefly touch upon theſe three Scriptures we then had in diſputation. The firſt is, <hi>Act.</hi> 2.38, 39. <hi>The promiſe is to you and to your children, &amp;c.</hi> The <hi>Promiſe</hi> in this place was conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded upon, that it was <hi>remiſſion of ſins,</hi> and the <hi>gifts of the holy ſpirit:</hi> hence was drawn this concluſion, <hi>that the infants of believers found as large an intereſt in this promiſe as their parents, and therefore ought to bee bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Which I cannot but deny, and aſſirme, that the promiſe here was to the Iews, as many as the Lord did call; to their children, as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny as the Lord ſhould call: to the Gentiler afar off, as many of them as the Lord ſhould call: There is a ſound truth in the Scripture thus interpreted; for God gave <hi>remiſſion of ſius, his ſpirit, all the good things of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel,</hi> to as many as he called, both Iow and Gentile, and ſo he will to the worlds end, and indeed he never promiſed it to any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, <hi>He that believeth on the Son hath life.
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:119599:91"/>he that believeth not hath not life, Joh.</hi> 3.31. If the promiſe of the <hi>Covenant of grace, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of ſins, and the goodthings of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel,</hi> had been to the Iews that beleeved, and to their naturall ſeed, it muſt then have been made good to them, or elſe there was no truth in the promiſe, but it was never made good to them, for then they had not been apoſtated, as they are to this day, nay, the Lord was ſo far from intending any ſuch thing to the Iews, that hee intended their rejection and caſting off, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.15. nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was the promiſe to the naturall ſeed of the believing Gentiles, but the elect of God both Iews and Gentiles obtain it, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.7. and God under the Goſpel makes no diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence between the ſeed of the believer and unbeliever, with relation to their Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but it is <hi>grace</hi> that makes the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference.</p>
            <p>The ſecond Scripture was, <hi>Mar.</hi> 10.13, 14. <hi>Suffer little children to come unto me, and forbid them not, for of ſuch is the Kingdome of God.</hi> That which is hence inferred is, that children are bleſſed, that they are a part of the Church, and therefore have a right to baptiſme, whereas it is very probable that thoſe infants were brought to Chriſt to be
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:119599:91"/>cured of ſome diſeaſes, for the Text ſayth, They <hi>brought young children to him, that he might touch them, and he bleſſed them,</hi> that is, gave them the bleſſing they came for, to wit, health and cure: and whereas Chriſt ſayth, <hi>of ſuch is the kingdome of heaven,</hi> that is, of ſuch qualified ſpiritually as thoſe infants were naturally, ſo Chriſt himſelfe interprets it, <hi>ver,</hi> 15. <hi>Verily I ſay unto you, whoſoever doth not receive the Kingdome of Heaven, as a little childe, be ſhall not enter therein:</hi> that is, whoſoever doth not receive the Kingdom of God, both of grace and glory, as a little childe, that is, humble and meek, and teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, able to doe nothing himſelfe, but Chriſt is his all and in all he ſhall never enter there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in; ſo that Chriſt takes occaſion from thoſe little infants, to diſcover a Goſpel myſtery, a myſtery indeed to naturall men, <hi>Mat.</hi> 18.2, 3.</p>
            <p>The third Scripture was that in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.14. <hi>The unbelieving wife is ſanctified to the believing husband, elſe were your children un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean, but now are they holy.</hi> Now it was firſt granted, that the ſanctification of the wife is but a civill ſanctification, ſhee is ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified to his uſe, that he ought not to put her away. 2 This was granted alſo, that
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:119599:92"/>holineſſe is a fruit of ſanctification: then I ſay, the fruit or effect, cannot be greater then the cauſe, the cauſe cannot produce a greater effect then it ſelfe, the cauſe being onely a civill ſanctification, the holineſſe of the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren muſt be the ſame; ſo that now under the Goſpel, the believer may lawfully keepe the unbeliever, whether huſband or wife, and their children, whereas under the Law, if a Iew marryed with an idolatrous Gentile, he was to put away both wife and children, <hi>Ezra.</hi> 10.3. but under the Goſpel there is no ſuch thing, unleſſe the unbeliever will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part.</p>
            <p n="2">2 After faith and baptiſme, the will and command of Chriſt is, that his people ſhould yield obedience to all his comands, &amp; indeed he doth not onely command it, but gives power: there is a power goes with the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands of Chriſt: he is the King of his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, he gives laws and ſtatutes, and withall gives in abilities to doe what he commands: Chriſt knows that <hi>without him you can doe nothing, John</hi> 15.5, the will and commands of Chriſt is, that his people <hi>ſhould be holy is all manner of holy converſation:</hi> the will of God is their ſanctification, 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 4.2.3. <hi>For yee know what commandements we gave
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:119599:92"/>you by the Lord Ieſus, for this is the will of God your ſanctification, to abſtain from ſin,</hi> to ver. 7. and the reaſon is rendred, <hi>ver.</hi> 7. <hi>For God hath not called us unto uncleanueſſe, but unto holineſſe:</hi> God hath not given his Son to redeeme men, that ſo they might live in unclean, unholy ways, he doth not call them to fellowſhip with himſelfe, and one with another, that ſo they might take their plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures in the world, in ſin; no, no, God calls his to holineſſe, and therefore the Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> ſayth, <hi>It is written, be yee holy,</hi> (or yee ſhall be holy) <hi>as I the Lord your God am ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly:</hi> 1 Pet. 1.16. <hi>And he that hath this hope purifieth himſelfe, even as Chriſt is pure,</hi> 1 <hi>Iohn</hi> 3.3, And the Apoſtle <hi>Pauls</hi> exhorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion anſwers this command, <hi>Rom.</hi> 12.1. <hi>I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech you brethren by the mercies of God, that yee preſent your bodies a living ſacrifice, holy and acceptable unto God, which is your reaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable ſervice, and be not conformable to this world, but be yee transformed by the renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of your mindes, &amp;c.</hi> that is, ſeeing God hath renewed your mindes, let your bodies, your externall walkings, be made conforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to Ieſus Chriſt, and not to the world. O beloved, holineſſe becomes the Saints, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially holineſſe becomes the houſhold of
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:119599:93"/>Saints the Churches of Saints: the Church of Saints is <hi>Gods houſe,</hi> 1 Tim. 3.10. <hi>his dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling place,</hi> Pſal. 132.13, 14. and holineſſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes the Lords houſe for ever, and it is the love of Chriſt that conſtrains the Saints thus to walk?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Queſt.</hi> But is it not the Saints duty, thus to walke.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> Yea, without queſtion it is their duty, <hi>Gal.</hi> 6 16. <hi>He that walketh according to this rule, peace ſhall be upon him:</hi> but they are to performe this duty of holy walking out of love, therefore Chriſt ſayth, <hi>If yee love me keepe my commandemenst, Iohn</hi> 14.15. none hath to doe with the commands of Chriſt but thoſe that love him, which love flows from faith, <hi>for faith worketh by love,</hi> Gal. 5.6.</p>
            <p>A ſecond command of Chriſt is, love the Saints, which was the ſecond thing I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded in the manifeſtation of love. It is firſt <hi>to Chriſt, Hee that loveth not the Lord. Ieſus, let him be accurſed:</hi> ver. 17. <hi>Theſe things I command you, that yee love one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther:</hi> And, <hi>a new commandement give I un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you, that you love one another, as I have lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved you.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Queſt.</hi> Why is it called a <hi>New</hi> comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement,
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:119599:93"/>ſeeing it is not new, but the ſame that was from the beginning.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1 It is New, becauſe given a new by Chriſt, and ſo are all the commands of Chriſt given a new, and are new commands given to a new people, to wit, believers; <hi>Moſe's</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands were given to all the whole body of naturall Iſrael: Chriſts to the whole body of ſpirituall Iſrael, the Saints. None elſe hath to doe with any law as it comes from Chriſt, but are ſtill under the Law, as it came from Mount <hi>Sinay.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2 It is new in reſpect of the nature of it, which is double: 1 as it flows from Chriſts love to us. 2 It muſt be the ſame as Chriſts love was to us ever; <hi>as I have loved you:</hi> and as this is the ſpeciall comand of Chriſt, ſo it is the property of the Saints, that the grace they receive from Chriſt, cauſeth them to doe it: <hi>the love of Chriſt conſtrains them.</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Apoſtle thanks God for the <hi>Coloſſians, Col.</hi> 1.3, 4. <hi>For the increaſe of their faith, and love to all the Saints.</hi> Where faith increaſeth, love increaſeth: for faith increaſeth love to Chriſt: and love to Chriſt increaſeth love to the Saints.</p>
            <p>For my more cleer proceeding in this par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular, I ſhall endevour from light and truth
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:119599:94"/>to diſcover unto you, firſt, what love is. 2 the excellent properties and effects of this love. 3 the manifeſtation of this love.</p>
            <p n="1">1 What love is: <hi>Love is an affection of the ſoule carried forth after, and ſetled upon, ſomething, from an apprehended worth and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency in the thing:</hi> this I conceive to be love, whether it be ſpirituall or naturall; whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſet upon a good or bad object: for it is not poſſible there ſhould be true love, but where the ſoul apprehends ſomething worthy to be beloved. Firſt, the underſtanding goes forth, and takes a view of the object preſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted: if the underſtanding ſo apprehend any worth or excellency in the object preſented, then the affection of love is let forth upon it, and is not ſatisfied without the enjoyment of it. Hence it comes to paſſe that when the underſtanding is truly enlightned, and the judgement rightly informed, the affection is carried forth, and ſetled upon a right object: but if the underſtanding be corrupted and blinded, and the judgement miſinformed, the affection of love is carried forth after, and ſet upon wrong objects. When the underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is ſo blinded, it apprehends an excellency in the world, in pleaſures, in ſin, &amp;c. for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve it; it is the blindneſſe of mens under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:119599:94"/>uſually, that cauſeth men to love ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully.</p>
            <p>So on the contrary, when Chriſt is preſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the view of the ſoule, the underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by the power of God, is enlightned, and comes to apprehend in ſome meaſure, that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent worth, that is in him, the affection of love goes forth after him: and deſire is not ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied untill it enjoy him. Thus it was with the Spouſe in the Canticles, chap. 5.10. <hi>My beloved is white and ruddy, the chiefeſt among ten thouſand:</hi> and hence it is, her love is ſo drawn forth after him: that ſhee ſeeks him, and is never ſatisfied till ſhe find him, verſ. 6. ſhe is ſick of love after him, chap. 2.5. and this love unto Chriſt carries forth the ſoule in love to the Saints, for the ſake of Chriſt, where it ſees the Image of Chriſt: the ſame love where with the ſoule loves Chriſt, it loves the Saints, 1 <hi>Iohn</hi> 4.20, 21.</p>
            <p>That it is the command of Chriſt, and the property of the love of God, where it is ſhed abroad in the heart, to carry forth the ſoul in love, not only to Chriſt, but to the Saints, you have heard: 1 John 5.1. <hi>Every one that loves him that begate, loveth him alſo that is begotten.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2 I come to the excellent properties and
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:119599:95"/>effects of this love. 1 With relation to Chriſt. 2 To the Saints. 1 To Chriſt. 2 It refuſes to receive ſatisfaction in any en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment beneath the Lord Jeſus. A ſoule truly enlightned in the excellency of the knowledge of God in Chriſt, refuſeth to take content and ſatisfaction in any thing that comes ſhort of Chriſt. It is true, there may be many turnings and windings in the heart, and the profits and pleaſures of the world, ſhall be preſented (as Satan preſented them to Chriſt) and duties and creatures, and performances, gifts, &amp;c. and thus Satan can, and often doth preſent him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf like an Angell of light, and that to the Saints too: they that know any thing of God, know it, if poſſibly he could, hee would de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lude and cheat a poore creature, but the ſoul truly loving Chriſt will not be thus cheated and deluded, by that old Serpent, he muſt have Chriſt, nothing leſſe will ſatisfie him. A living child may be quieted awhile with a bable, a counter, or ratle, which is nothing but folly: but in concluſion, it findes by experience the emptineſſe and vanity of ſuch things, then caſts away all, and nothing but bread will ſatisfie him. So it may be with the ſoule the living Chriſtian, it may receive ſome content in duties and prayers for a time; but in the concluſion it comes to
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:119599:95"/>ſee the emptineſſe of theſe things, and then nothing but Chriſt will content him. When a ſoule truly loving Chriſt, comes to ſee how he hath deluded himſelfe in miſtaking Chriſt, thinking that he hath had Chriſt, when in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed he had nothing but the externall ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, viſible forme, which is indeed the ſhell without the kernell, ô then nothing leſſe then a Chriſt will ſatisfie: ô give me Chriſt, ſayth the ſoule, or elſe I die, Chriſt in every ordinance: it will not take ordinances and duties for Chriſt any more: but now the ſoule muſt enjoy Chriſt in ordinances, Chriſt in preaching, in praying, in the Supper of the Lord, nothing gives content to the ſoule but Chriſt: O this is the excellent quality of true ſpirituall love to the Lord Ieſus. Hence it is that the ſpouſe in the <hi>Canticles, Cap.</hi> 3.12. ſo earneſtly ſeeks her beloved, ſhee could take no reſt untill ſhee had found him, <hi>ver.</hi> 4. and then ſhee holds him, and will not let him goe. This is the property of love, it ſoars very high, flies aloft like the Eagle, and why? becauſe God in Chriſt is its object, and where the dead carkeſſe is, thither will the Eagles be gathered together: Chriſt is the alone object of faith and love, and to him all true beleevers come, in him ſhall all the ſeed of Iſrael be juſtified, and ſhall glory, <hi>Eſay</hi> 45.25.
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:119599:96"/>onely note this, that the ſoule comes by faith to enjoy him whom the ſoule loves.</p>
            <p>A ſecond excellencie of love to the Lord Jeſus is, It is quieted and ſatisfied in the ſingle enjoyment of Chriſt: the ſoul that hath Chriſt hath enough, it can ſay as <hi>Jacob, It is enough,</hi> Ioſeph <hi>my ſon is yet alive;</hi> ſo the believing ſoule, whoſe heart is truly inflamed with love to Chriſt for his own excellencie, it hath e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, it is content now to loſe all, as the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle <hi>Paul,</hi> Phil. 3.7.8. <hi>He accounts all things but loſſe, yea, dung, that he may win Chriſt,</hi> This is the excellencie of the grace of love to Chriſt, it carries the ſoule above the world, above creature, or any thing beneath Chriſt, it deſires nothing but Chriſt, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.1. It gloryeth and rejoyceth in nothing but Chriſt, <hi>Gal.</hi> 6.14. and him crucified: If it have the world, ſo it is, if not it is contented, it is quiet in any condition, if it enjoy all things, I mean (in the world) yet Chriſt is the ſumme of all: if it want all things, yet in Chriſt it enjoyes all, ſo the Apoſtle, as <hi>having nothing, yet poſſeſſing all things,</hi> ſo that now the ſoule that believes in, and loves the Lord Jeſus, knows how to be abaſed, and how to abound, that is, it know how in that loweſt condition to live ſatisfied upon Chriſt,
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:119599:96"/>and it knows how in the higheſt condition to live alſo upon Chriſt, it can doe all things through Chriſt that ſtrengthens it, <hi>Phil.</hi> 4.12, 13. Doe you not ſee on the contrary, men that have no love to the Lord Jeſus, how they let forth their hearts upon the creature? they live upon the creature; take away the world from them, you take away their life: but the man that loves Chriſt, hath enough in the enjoyment of him, what ever befall them in the world, they can ſay as Chriſt, <hi>I have meat to eate that yee know not of, John.</hi> 4.32. the Lord Ieſus is the Saints meat and drinke they live upon him, and are ſatisfied with him.</p>
            <p>The third property of love is, It ſlights all hardſhips and ſufferings that it meets withall for the name and ſake of Chriſt. Nothing can quench this love, many waters cannot quench it: many flouds of affliction cannot quench love: when others that love not the Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus but themſelves, and their own eaſe, ſtart and are affrighted at the reproach of Jeſus, as at ſome ſtrange apparition; when the ſoul that ſees ſpiritually, that looks not at things that are ſeen, that is at the outſide of things, which carnal eys only ſee, but at things that are not ſeen, that is at the outſide of things, which
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:119599:97"/>carnall eyes: They hence go cheerfully, ſligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting perſecutions being perſwaded that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing can make a ſeparation betweene Chriſt and their ſouls; glorying and triumphing in the croſſe of Chriſt, being not only ready to ſuffer reproach, but death it ſelf, if the Lord call them to it, for the name and ſake of their beloved. Thus you ſee the excellencie of this grace, it carries the ſoule ſweetly out to Chriſt, it lies down in the boſome of love, and there it is ſatiated, there it is ſatisfied, there it hath enough, there it lives, and there it dies, yet with him it ſhal for ever live, ô the admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable excellencie, in this grace of love, it makes hard things eaſie, and bitter things ſweet: it lives upon that others canot ſee, no, not never ſhall ſee, unleſſe the Lord open their eyes, it rejoyceth in that others dread: it takes that for a crown, that others count ſhame: it makes their hearts to leap for joy, in the beholding of thoſe things, that makes others faint and fail.</p>
            <p n="2">2 I come to the excellencie of this grace of love, <hi>in,</hi> and <hi>to</hi> the Saints, for that is the great thing we have now in hand, the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencie of the grace of love among Saints, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong brethren.</p>
            <p n="1">1 It is of a knitting nature, it knits or
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:119599:97"/>bindes up the ſoules of the Saints as one, it makes them to be of one heart and of one minde. What is the reaſon of ſuch diviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons amongſt Saints, but the want of love? this grace of love is that which would knit the hearts of chriſtians one to another: It was the Apoſtles deſire and care for the <hi>Coloſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſians, that their hearts might be comforted, being knit together in love, Col.</hi> 2.2. This knitting together of the Saints, is that which makes them meet to watch over each other, to build up each other: it is as the joynts and ſinews of the body naturall, knitting each member together, and ſo nouriſhing the whole body, <hi>Col.</hi> 2.9. <hi>Being knit together in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſeth, with the increaſe of God,</hi> this is the excellent property of love, it knitts up the ſouls of the Saints together, where it is in truth, there cannot be an eaſie diſſolving of this knot of love, this was the love of <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Jonathan</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 18.1. <hi>The ſoule of</hi> Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nathan <hi>was knit with the ſoule of</hi> David, <hi>and</hi> Ionathan <hi>loved him as his own ſoule:</hi> this is the true property of love, it knits the ſoul to the partie beloved: it is not poſſible, if there were true love that there ſhould be ſuch di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions amongſt the Saints: if it be but a difference in opinion, preſently, the love,
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:119599:98"/>the fellowſhip is broken.</p>
            <p>A ſecond excellencie of true love is, It coven a multitude of infirmities, it is not eaſily mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, it is not eaſily provoked, it is naturally eaſie to be intreated, it will not ſuddainly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve evill reports, it will not ſuddainly have bitter envyings and evill ſurmiſings: this is the excellencie of the grace of love, it will bear much and long, it will not cenſure with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out wonderfull juſt cauſe, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.4, 5, 6, 7. <hi>Love ſuffereth long, it is not eaſily provoked,</hi> it will not ſtarte at ſhadows, love envyeth not anothers proſperity, but rather rejoyceth in it, as one member of the body rejoyceth in the proſperity of another, it vaunteth not itſelfe, it is not puffed up, love is an humble grace, it maketh thoſe in whom it is, to ſerve each other in love, to prefer each other be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore itſelfe: it ſeeketh not its own, it ſeeketh not its ſelfe, but the good of another, it is not eaſily provoked, it thinketh noill, it rejoyceth not in iniquity, but rejoyceth in the truth, it beareth all things it believeth all things (all things that it hath any ground or warrant to believe) it hopeth althings, that is, the beſt of all things, where there is any ground or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability of hope it endureth all things, that is, all things that God himſelf inflicts, or ſuffers
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:119599:98"/>man to inflict upon him, here is the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencie of love O who would be without this grace of love? nay, but who can ever attain it but thoſe, whom God ſheds abroad his love in their hearts by his holy Spirit? how is this grace of love wanting among the Saints? whence is it that there are ſuch diſcords? ſuch bitter enyings? ſuch ſecret whiſperings? in a word, ſuch rents and breaches of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion and fellowſhip amongſt Saints, for ſlight things, but the want of this grace of love? truly, were the love of God ſhed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad in the hearts of his people more abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly it would not be thus: love is of ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute neceſſity, for the peace and communion of Saints.</p>
            <p n="3">3 Excellencie of love. It is, on everlaſting grace, it ſhall be made perfect in another world: other graces fail, but love never fail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth: 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.8. <hi>Propheſies they fail, and faith that ſhall ceaſe, but love ſhall abide for euer,</hi> it ſhall be ſo far from ceaſing, that it ſhall after the ceaſing of faith and other gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, be made perfect, and the Saints that love God indeed here (and from that fountain of love, love each other) they ſhall then for ever live in the boſome of love, their ſouls being ſatisfied in the enjoyment of him the
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:119599:99"/>fountain, they ſhall be then perfectly knit to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether in one, being filled with the enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God, made perfect in love, through that abundance of love it enjoyes in him.</p>
            <p>The third particular propounded is, the manifeſtation of this love, how the Saints manifeſt this their love each to other.</p>
            <p n="1">1 In a faithfull diligent watching over each other in love, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.4. look not every one to his own things, but every one to the things one of another: there ſhould not be ſuch a ſpirit amongſt Chriſtians as was in <hi>Cain,</hi> who ſaid, <hi>Am I my brothers keeper:</hi> no, no, you are keepers of each other, and it is love that will make you faithfull to each o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers ſoule in this particular.</p>
            <p>The ſecond manifeſtation of love is, in building up one the other in the moſt holy faith, edifying one the other in love, helping forward each other in the way of holineſſe being compacted together in the order &amp; fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowſhip of the Goſpel, maketh increaſe of the body, to the edifying it ſelf in love <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.16.</p>
            <p n="3">3 In bearing with the weakneſſes of each other, <hi>Col.</hi> 3.12, 13. <hi>Put on, as the elect of God bewels of mercie, kindneſſe, humbleneſſe of minde, meekneſſe, long ſuffering, for bearing one another, and for giving one another, even
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:119599:99"/>as God for Chriſts ſake forgave you.</hi> Here is the manifeſtation of love, when you are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to beare with, and forbeare one another, from this principle, becauſe God hath borne with you, God hath forgiven you, <hi>Rom.</hi> 14.1. <hi>him that is weak in the faith, receive unto you.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4 In reſtoring a falne brother with the ſpirit of meekneſſe, <hi>Gal.</hi> 6.1. <hi>If any brother be falne through weakneſſe, yee that are ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall, reſtore ſuch a one with the ſpirit of weekneſſe:</hi> much tenderneſſe is to bee uſed towards a brother in this caſe; the ground is, we our ſelves, the ſtrongeſt of us are ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to, and may fall by the like temptation, if the Lord prevent it not.</p>
            <p n="5">5 In ſpeaking kindly to each other; good words and comfortable: this is the manife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtation of love: and truly where there is love in the heart, it will appear in the counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, in the words; a cheerfull and loving countenance, loving words; here will be words both for the Saints, and to the Saints. Firſt, for the Saints to go to God in prayer, <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſ.</hi> 1.16. for them, in their vindication, when any ſcandall is unjuſtly laid upon them: ſo <hi>Ionathan</hi> for <hi>David,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 19.4. <hi>Ionathan</hi> ſpake good of <hi>David,</hi> and good for <hi>David</hi> 2 In ſpeaking kindly one to another, ſo the
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:119599:100"/>Apoſtle <hi>Paul,</hi> he ever gives the Saints the ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle of <hi>Brethren,</hi> wherefore holy <hi>Brethren,</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers of the heavenly calling: and <hi>Solomon</hi> ſayth, <hi>That a ſoft anſwer turneth away ſtrife.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="6">6 And laſtly, love is manifeſted incondo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling each with other, in afflictions: the Saints are all of them members of the body of Chriſt, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.27. and the members of the naturall body are ſenſible of the ſufferings of each other, if one member ſuffer all ſuffer with it; if one member rejoyce, all rejoyce with it: ſo it is or ſhould be in the body ſpirituall, we ſhould beare part of one anothers afflictions; be truly ſenſible of the affliction of each other, and ſo beare part with each other, bee truly ſenſible of the comſorts of each other, and ſo rejoice together, this is the property of true love where it is: I have very briefly hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted upon ſome particulars, much more might be ſaid in this particular: but I deſire not to be tedious in this place. I might branch forth in many other particular Goſpel commands which would be too tedious: only thus, where the love of Chriſt is indeed ſhed abroad by the holy ſpirit, there love co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſtrains the ſoul to yeeld itſelf up wholly to the Lord Jeſus, &amp; all his comands: whatſoever things are of good report, whatſoever things are lovely, whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:119599:100"/>things are warranted, and required in Goſpel, the ſoule that truly loves the Lord Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus, is ready in the peace and ſtrength of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus to walk up unto it: it will not conſult with fleſh and bloud, it will not ſtand upon carnall arguments: but as the Lord Jeſus hath glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied mercy, grace, and love, in doing unto the ſoule, ſo it will now look what it is may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce to the exaltation of his name, &amp; then the ſoule that truly loves the Lord Jeſus, is ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied; let the name of Ieſus have the glory, and the ſoul that truly loves him, hath its end, and and reſts ſatisfied.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Uſe.</hi> It concernes every one to looke if Chriſt hath been their Prophet: hath Chriſt given thee a heart willing to ſubmit unto him in all things? ready in his power to yeeld u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niverſall obedience to all his commands? ô it neerly concerns you, to try your ſelves, and if ſo, then whether your obedience flows from love. It is poſſible there may be externall obedience from baſe and by-ends, and then all is nothing; <hi>Love is the fulfilling of the Law:</hi> whatſoever is done in love, that is, from the love, of Chriſt ſhed abroad in the heart, is well done: but all done without love is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing; preaching, praying, profeſſing, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municating, it is all nothing without love: it
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:119599:101"/>is one thing, to preach, and pray, and profeſſe, it is another thing to doe it out of love to Chriſt; then it is a fruit of faith. <hi>Faith work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth by love,</hi> and all works done without this, are not acceptable, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.1, 2. <hi>Though I ſpeak with the tongue of men and angels, and have not love, it is nothing, it is but as a ſoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding braſſe or tinkling eymball:</hi> a man may have excellent words, fine compoſed ſentences) admirable expreſſions, all flowing from a no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionall knowledge, that may much affect the eares and hearts of the people, and yet all be but a ſound of words attained by art, as a ſounding braſſe or a tinkling cymball, which ſeems to make a ſweet ſound to the eare, when there is nothing in it indeed but a compoſure of humane art; and ſo being brought out of that frame, there is nothing indeed worth looking after, or harkning unto: even ſo are thoſe perſons, who ſeemingly do glorious a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, and yet indeed have not the love of God in them.</p>
            <p>But to proceed: the third thing that Chriſt uſually teacheth his people, as to beleeve, which faith, you have heard, produceth its effects, ſo in the third place he teacheth them to live by faith, that is, to act and exerciſe this faith upon all occaſions, in all times, according
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:119599:101"/>as they have need, to make uſe of it: and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed this is a great Goſpel myſtery, which the Saints are too much ignorant of. It is one thing to have faith, and another to live by faith it is one thing to have legs, and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thing to make uſe of them, to goe with them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Queſt.</hi> What is it to live by faith?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1 It is to exerciſe faith, that is to make uſe of it as need requires: or, 2 It is a living upon Chriſt in the want of all things. Or 3 It is a living by believing of what the ſoul ſhall one day enjoy.</p>
            <p n="1">1 It is to exerciſe faith as occaſion calls for it: that is, to exerciſe it upon the object: for faith hath ever an object, and if it be right and true, the object is Chriſt: now it is true, there is occaſion for the Chriſtian to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe faith in every condition, either <hi>Internal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> or <hi>Externally,</hi> for the Chriſtian hath many enemies to encounter with all, the fleſh, and the Devill and the World, all theſe comes in a mayn upon the ſoul. Now faith overcomes; 1 The <hi>fleſh</hi> that will be ever luſting againſt the ſpirit, Satan comming in, working by it; ſelf will be in every action, ſelf wiſdom, ſelf priding, and ſelf boaſting: this is contrary to the mind of the ſpirit, and now the ſpirit is
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:119599:102"/>troubled, and freed, ſo that many times there is a hot conflict in the ſoule of the Saint: but how comes the Chriſtian to overcome it? by cying and applying Chriſt, it can ſay as <hi>Paul,</hi> I haue a body of ſin, a proud curſed ſelf ſeek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing nature, <hi>but thanks to God through Jeſus Chriſt, &amp;c. and there is no condemnation to them in Chriſt.</hi> It is true, I have a baſe na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, a wicked, curſed, deceitfull, proud, ſelf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeeking heart, yet the Lord hath let forth a glimpſe of his glory to my ſoul, hee hath let mee ſee, and hath ſealed this by his ſpirit unto me, that I am in Chriſt, and there is no condemnation for me: and ſo by faith, ſeeking to Chriſt, the ſoul overcomes this enemy <hi>fleſh.</hi> and then ſecondly, it ever lives in believing, that this fleſhly corrupt part, ſhall be every day more and more ſubdued, and ſo is ever cying a crucified Chriſt, for the killing and crucifying of this body of ſin.</p>
            <p n="2">2 The <hi>Devill,</hi> hee will come in with his darts, daying hard and heavy things to the charge of the ſoul, although the Apoſtle faith, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.33. <hi>Who ſhall lay any thing to the charge of Gods Elect? It is God that juſtifieth:</hi> although God himſelf pronounce a man cleet and juſt, yet the Devill will come in and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>devour to make work in the godly juſtified
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:119599:102"/>ſoule. O ſayth the Devill, thou art a vile cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed creature, thou haſt a baſe earthly carnall heart, thou art able to performe no duty, but it is full of ſin, and as good never a whit, as never the better. Thy ſervices (hadſt thou no other ſin to be accountable for) are enough to condemne thee? and beſides all the reſt of thy ſins of thy baſeneſſe in performing duty, this is that is worſt of all, thou haſt a wicked proud heart of thine owne, thou art ready, when ever God hath aſſiſted thee, to take the honour to thy ſelfe, and to pride thy ſelfe in thoſe weak duties thou performeſt.</p>
            <p>What ſayſt thou to this Chriſtian? haſt any experience of this try all in thy ſoule? I dare ſay thou haſt, if Chriſt dwell there: but what courſe will you take to over come in this combat? ſee <hi>Epheſ</hi> 6.16. There are the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies the Saints are to encounter with, they are no ſmall, no mean enemies, ſee <hi>Verſe</hi> 12. and the armour; the Chriſtians armour its all armour of proof; but above all take the ſheeld of faith, wherewith ye ſhall be able to quench all the fire darts of the wicked: the Devill will come, and come againe, hee will have one dart, and another dart: now the way to overcome, is to take the ſhield of faith: a ſheeld is for defence, ſo this faith both
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:119599:103"/>defends and reſiſts the Devill.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Queſt.</hi> But how doth faith overcome?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> It ever hath an eye to the foundation Chriſt, it knows the foundation ſtandeth ſure, and ſo it turns over the devill, the falſe concluſion that the devill and the heart is ready to make together to Chriſt: and now the ſoule ſayth, it is true <hi>Satan,</hi> or it is true <hi>heart,</hi> I am baſe, I have a vile curſed nature, I cannot pray nor performe any duty as I ſhould, ſin is in my beſt action, I confeſſe I am in my ſelfe as bad as man or devill can make, not a worſe heart in the world more ſubject to evill, farther then God reſtrains it, more unable to doe good, farther then God inables: and what of all this <hi>Satan?</hi> I know there is enough to condemne me for ever, were I to anſwer in mine own perſon for my ſelfe; but Chriſt hath been condemned for me, Satan, he hath borne all my ſins, and ſo my condemnation, and he hath made himſelfe over to me, ſo that now thou muſt firſt have ſomething againſt Chriſt, before thou canſt ſhake my hold, and thus by faith flying to Chriſt, the ſoule overcomes the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my: but if the ſoule cannot thus have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe to the Lord Jeſus, he is gone when the tempter comes, he is not able to reſiſt. Then
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:119599:103"/>ſayth the beleeving ſoule, it is true, Satan, I have a proud ſelf ſeeking heart, ready ever to take that honour to it ſelfe that is due to God; but it is as true, that I may thank thee for it, who haſt thus metamorphozed my nature, and made it like thine own, and not onely ſo, but commeſt in and ever ſtirroſt up the heart to pride and ſelfe-ſeeking, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing well by experience, that it is a ſin that much provokes God; but this is my mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, God lets me ſee into this depth of wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſſe, and it is my burthen: but Chriſt hath freed me from the power of it, and from the iniquity of it, hee is ever ſubduing it in me, and one day I ſhall for ever be freed, both from it and thee: thus by faith the ſoule over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes the devill: this is the firſt particular wherein the Chriſtian comes to liue by faith, in the exerciſing of it, according to the many<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold occaſions it meets withall.</p>
            <p n="2">2 To live by faith is a living upon Chriſt in the want of all things, and that both ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall and internall.</p>
            <p n="1">1 <hi>Externall,</hi> in the want of outward things: when the creature is tripped naked and bare, brought even to a morſell of bread, then to live in beleeving the Lord will care for you, when that you are brought to Chriſts
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:119599:104"/>condition, that you have neither houſe nor home, nor any thing in the world, beſides a Chriſt beſides a God to live upon; then when thou canſt get a promiſe, as that <hi>Heb.</hi> 13.5. He hath ſayd, <hi>I will not fail thee, nor for ſake thee,</hi> and ſtick cloſe to the Lord Jeſus in ſuch a promiſe, this is a living by faith, when the creature fails <hi>Hab.</hi> 3.17, 18. <hi>Although the figtree ſhall not bloſſome, neither ſhall fruit be in the vine, the labour of the olive ſhall fail, and the fields ſhall yeeld no meat, the flock ſhall be cut off from the fold, and there ſhall be no therd in the ſtalls: Yet will I rejoyce in the Lord, I will joy in the God of my ſalvation?</hi> This is to live by faith, when all creatures fail, then to live upon God, then to rejoyce in the Lord, believing that God is able and will help, the Lord will ſuſtain. The want of this faith, was Iſraels ſin, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 78.18, 19. they ſpake againſt God and ſayd, <hi>Can God prepare a table in the wilderneſſe?</hi> how is the deceitfull heart of man ready to diſtruſt God in ſuch a condition as thoſe Jews? can God prepare a table when all is gone? but faith in ſuch a condition, believes, and lives by blieving, and the Lord will care for moe ſayth the ſoule, and the Lord hath ſayd it: <hi>The lions ſhall luck, and ſuffer hunger, but
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:119599:104"/>they that wait upon the Lord ſhall want no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that is good.</hi> This is a hard thing, it is eaſily ſayd, but not ſo eaſily done; you thinke it is eaſie, perhaps, to live by faith, while you have a houſe, a calling that brings you in money, perhaps every day or every week, or money by you, or land, &amp;c. you can live comfortably upon Chriſt and your cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, upon Chriſt and your houſe or land, but let all be taken from thee, ſee then how then canſt live? this may be your condition, and then you will be put to the tryall.</p>
            <p n="2">2 <hi>Spiritually,</hi> when the ſoule hath nothing of its own to reſt upon, when duties and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formances and all is gone, then to believe and live by believing: this is to live by faith indeed, upon this ground the ſoule believes, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.4.5. <hi>He that worketh not, but believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth on him that juſtifieth the ungodly, his faith is counted to him for righteouſneſſe,</hi> he that worketh not, he that cannot performe one acceptable duty in way of righteouſneſſe, but ſees all is nothing, yet believes in Chriſt, and ſo lives by believing, this is the conſtant ſtay of a believer, he everſees his own emp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tineſſe, the untighteouſneſſe of his beſt acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: I ſay, to believe in, and to live upon Chriſt in all ſuch conditions, it is to live by
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:119599:105"/>faith, above duties and performances: but how doe many a profeſſing man and woman comfort themſelves in the performing of duties, in their inlargement in duty, and the like, but when they fail in this, then they call all in queſtion again: this faith was not right, for they thinke they believe, becauſe they can pray and meditate, &amp;c. when indeed the ſoul that rightly believes, doth believe becauſe he cannot pray, nor act or doe any thing that is acceptable, and therefore he cannot live by faith, but when that power he has to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme duty fails, his faith and all fails, this is not to live by faith, yet this hath been the life of moſt profeſſours in this Nation.</p>
            <p n="3">3 A living by faith, it is to live by belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving of what the ſoule ſhall one day enjoy, and this mightily bears up the ſpirits of the Saints.</p>
            <p>And this we may take notice of under a threefold conſideration.</p>
            <p n="1">1 That which the gracious ſoule longs moſt after is the full enjoyment of God, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing leſſe can ſatisfie the believing ſoule, the ſoule that hath taſted how gracious the Lord is.

<pb n="193" facs="tcp:119599:105"/>earneſtly deſiring to be clothed upon with the houſe from heaven, and the reaſon is, <hi>ver.</hi> 7. for while we are here we walke, that is, live by faith, and not by ſenſe, while we are at home in the body, wee are abſent from the Lord, that is, abſent comparatively with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation to what it ſhall be, for the ſoule has but a glimpſe of glory, but a taſt of the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencie it ſhall one day enjoy, in Chriſt.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Queſt.</hi> Now what is it that bears up the ſoule in this condition? how doth the ſoule live in the want of this full enjoyment of God?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſwer.</hi> 1 By faith he can look upon God, as having a relation to him, God in Chriſt is my God, ſayth the ſoule, and I ſhall one day enjoy him, I ſhall one day ſee him and for ever be ſatisfied in the beholding of him, this quiets, this ſatisfies the believing ſoule, it is content to wait upon God, hee that believeth maketh not haſte: It is in this caſe with the believing Chriſtian, as with a loving and tender wife, her deſire is always to live in the enjoyment of her huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, but when her husband is abſent, far away from her, it may be ſhee receives now and then a comfortable letter from him, wherein ſhee ſees a glimpſe of his love, and
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:119599:106"/>reads his letter, and wil have as much fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip with him in his letter as ſhee can: ſhee will look to every word, every ſentence, and note what expreſſions of love ſhee can finde there, and then ſhee is cheer'd and comforted: I have a letter from my husband, ſayth the loving wife, wherein he lets ſorth a caſte of his kindneſſe and love unto me: O here are ſweet words of love, of a tender affection! But ſayth the wiſe, this is not all, hee will come home unto me at the time appointed, and I ſhall enjoy him, and this is that which moſt of all cheeres up the heart of the wife, my husband will returne at the time ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed.</p>
            <p>Thus it is with the beleeving Chriſtian no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing leſſe then the enjoyment of God can give ſatisfaction to the ſoule that hath once raſted of him: but beloved the Lord Jeſus, the ſouls <hi>beloved,</hi> is gone as far as any, hee hath only eſpouſed, betrothed, the ſoule to himſelf, he hath reſerved the full enjoyment that the beleeving ſoule ſhall have in him, till another world; only hee diſcovers this his love, lets forth a glimpſe of his glory, into the ſouls of the Saints; and then the ſoule having once taſted of God, how good, how gracious, the Lord is; then nothing, but the full enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:119599:106"/>of Chriſt can ſatisfie. Now the Lord Chriſt hath left his word here for his beloved, to have recourſe unto, and there he hath made known his love, and his heart to his poore people: and now the ſoule that longs after Chriſt, hath recourſe to the Scripture, and there ſearches what Chriſt hath ſaid, &amp; when the ſoule meets Chriſt in the Scripture, then it is cheer'd, then it is comforted, here is a bleſſed word ſayth the ſoule, Chriſt is my <hi>all and in all,</hi> though I cannot come to the full enjoyment of him? and then the believing ſoule will to ordinances, preaching, and the Supper of the Lord, fellowſhip and commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of Saints, get what it can of Chriſt, meet with her beloved every way God hath appointed for that purpoſe: but ſtill, this is the great ſupport, my beloved will come at the time appointed, he is gone to receive for himſelfe a Kingdome, and he will return, and I ſhall enjoy him in his fulneſſe, in his perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, and here the ſoule lives and waits pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiently, here the anchor of hope is caſt, and holds the ſoule cloſe to the Lord Jeſus, living by believing what it ſhall one day enjoy, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.1.</p>
            <p n="2">2 That which the gracious ſoule longs af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is, a full and perfect freedome from
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:119599:107"/>corruption: it is that body of ſin that bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens the Saints, that is it makes them cry with the Apoſtle <hi>Paul, O wretched man that I am, Who ſhall deliver me from this body of death?</hi> and the gracious ſoule could well be contented ſomtimes to embrace death, that it might be freed from this body of death; under which God is pleaſed (for ends beſt known to himſelfe) to exerciſe his children under. Now what is it bears up the Spirits of the Saints in this condition? it is this, the believing of this, that they ſhall one day be rid of this baſe proud deceitful heart, a day is comming when I ſhall change this vile body of ſin, and I ſhall be made like unto the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious body of Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.21. I am already juſtified, and ſo made a Son, a daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of God, and this I know, I ſhall one day be made like unto him, 1 <hi>John</hi> 3.2. This is that which cheers the heart of a Chriſtian many times, when it is in a low condition, when put to a ſtand in the beholding of thoſe baſe haunts of heart, that it findes within it ſelfe: when perhaps it is put to a ſtand in the beholding of it: O ſayth the ſoule, what I after ſo much experience of Gods love, ſo much faith in the name of Jeſus, and have ſuch a baſe heart, ſuch a thought for wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:119599:107"/>the Chriſtian is ſomtimes put almoſt to a ſtand here: but then he comes to conſider, God is wiſe, and he is pleaſed to exerciſe me under this body of ſin, to keepe me in a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuall dependancie upon himſelfe, and this is my comfort, I ſhall one day be rid of all theſe enemies of mine, and I ſhall one day enjoy the Lord Jeſus, in his holineſſe and in his glory, <hi>When Chriſt which is my life ſhall appear, then ſhall I appear with him in glory, Col.</hi> 3.4. and in this caſe the believing ſoule lives in believing what it ſhall one day enjoy, namely, freedome from ſin, glorious liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, even the glorious liberty of the Sons of God.</p>
            <p n="3">3 The Saints of God are ſubject to affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions and reproaches while they are in this world, ſo Chriſt ſayth, <hi>Iohn.</hi> 16.3. <hi>In the world yee ſhall have tribulation:</hi> It is true, Chriſt hath prepared a Kingdome for them, but they are not like to enjoy it in this world, I mean that Kingdom of glory, although it is true, they enjoy much of God here in this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of grace, <hi>The Kingdom of God is within you.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But the Saints here are liable to perſecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and afflictions; now the beleeving Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian lives in beleeving it ſhall one day bee
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:119599:108"/>freed from thoſe hard things it ſuffered here, free'd from evill men, and I ſhall one day have a Kingdom, ſayth the ſoule: Thus <hi>Paul</hi> comforts himſelfe, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.1. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.5, 6, 7. and this was it with which <hi>Peter</hi> comforts the ſcattered Jews, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.3, 4, 5. <hi>They were begotten to an inheritance incorruptible, unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filed, reſerved in heaven for them,</hi> and this was the ground of that exhortation to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy to the end in time of affliction, <hi>Rev.</hi> 2.10. <hi>Be faithfull to the death, and you ſhall have a crown of life.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus Chriſtians have I indeavoured, both from the light of Scripture, add the light of experience, to hint out briefly unto you a taſte of the Chriſtians living by faith, and this Chriſt teacheth all thoſe whom he effectual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly teacheth. <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.38.</p>
            <p n="1">I might proceede to other particulars, namely, that Chriſt teacheth us to own him as our Prieſt, as our King: it is Chriſt our Prophet indeed, that teacheth us all things that we rightly know, we know nothing as we ought to know, farther then Chriſt Jeſus by his Spirit teacheth. But I proceed to the next particular propounded in the office or work of a Prophet, namely to work mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles; this the Prophets before Chriſt did,
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:119599:108"/>
               <hi>Moſes</hi> a type of Chriſt, and the great Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet of Iſrael, work't many miracles when the Lord ſent him to deliver his people.</p>
            <p>And this hath Chriſt our Prophet done, and doth to this day, this hee did when he was in the world, turning water into wine, rayſing the dead to life, reſtoring thoſe borne blinde to ſight, &amp;c. and this be ſtill doth, Chriſt our Prophet is ever working mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles: The converſion of a ſoule is a miracle, it is the changing of the nature, and it is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove nature to doe it, to raiſe a man from the dead to life is a miracle, and this Chriſt doth to every ſoule who is indeed raiſed, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2. the 1. and 5. <hi>verſes</hi> compared, <hi>ver.</hi> 1. <hi>and you who were dead in treſpaſſes and ſins,</hi> ver. 5. <hi>Even when wee were dead in ſins, hath hee quickned us, &amp;c.</hi> now to quicken, to give life to a dead ſoule is a miracle, and this Chriſt doth ordinarily; and hee gives ſight unto blinde men, it was a miracle for Chriſt to give ſight to the man that was borne blinde, beloved, every man and woman in the world is borne blinde, ſpiritually blinde, and this is a greater miracle to cure ſuch, yet this is the ordinary work of Chriſt: and every man na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally is both blinde, lame, and deaf, but Chriſt when he comes he opens the blinde
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:119599:109"/>eyes, he un-ſtops the deaf eares, he cauſeth the lame to walke, and the tongue of the dumb to ſing, <hi>Eſay.</hi> 35.5.</p>
            <p n="3">3 The Prophet did foretell of things to come, <hi>Moſes</hi> and the reſt did fore-tell Chriſt, &amp;c. and ſo did Chriſt in many particulars, <hi>Mat</hi> 24. but I paſſe this alſo.</p>
            <p n="2">2 Chriſt is to be exalted Prophet in the dayes of the Goſpel, ſee <hi>Act.</hi> 3.22, 23. <hi>A Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet ſhall the Lord your God raiſe up unto you, him ſhall you hear in all things.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Uſe</hi> 1. To examine if Chriſt have been thy Prophet. When Chriſt comes firſt to the ſoule, he findes men dead and gives life unto them, he findes men blinde and gives ſight unto them: Hath the Lord diſcovered thy dead condition unto thee, and given thee life? art borne from above? <hi>That which is borne of the fleſh is fleſh,</hi> and thou wert borne fleſh, dead in treſpaſſes and ſins, hath the Lord changed thee from a ſtate of death to a ſtate of life; from a ſtate of infidelity, to a ſtate of believing? thou wert blinde, thou wert borne blinde, not able to ſee into ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall things, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.14. Hath the Lord o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened thine eyes? canſt ſay I was blinde, but now I ſee, I was dumb, but now I ſpeak, ô this is worth your conſideration!</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="201" facs="tcp:119599:109"/>
               <hi>Uſe</hi> 2. A word of conſolation to the Saints whom the Lord Jeſus hath taught: what is the comfort, you will ſay?</p>
            <p n="1">1 He will for ever be thy Prophet, and will be ever teaching thee: <hi>Thou ſhalt hear a voyce behinde thee, ſaying, this is the way, walke yee in it, when thou turneſt to the right hand or to the left,</hi> the Lord Jeſus will be for ever thy Prophet, <hi>he will never fail thee nor for ſake thee: his eye ſhall ever be over thee for good, he will direct thee in all thy wayes,</hi> and is not this a mercy?</p>
            <p n="2">2 He hath made all the Saints Prophets, he hath powred down a ſpirit of Propheſie upon them, that now they are enabled by the ſpirit of propheſie to ſpeake one to another, for edification, exhortation, and conſolation, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14.3. and therefore the men of the world might hence be warned to take heed how they meddle with the Saints, to perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute them, for they are the Lords Prophets: 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 16.22. <hi>Touch not mine anointed, doe my Prophets no harme,</hi> Chriſt takes every wrong done to them, as done to himſelfe, therefore you had need look to it, for it is that which will work your ruine in the end.</p>

            <head>THE EXALTATION OF CHRIST The alone KING of SAINTS. CHAP. III.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Come to the Kingly Office of Chriſt: Chriſt is the alone King of his people: believe it, Chriſt is the alone King of his people: Chriſt is a King, and hee hath a Kindome, <hi>Pſal</hi> 45.6. His Kingdome is ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall, it is not <hi>of</hi> this world, although it is <hi>in</hi> the world.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="203" facs="tcp:119599:110"/>
Chriſt hath a twofold kingdome here in this world: there is the kingdome within the Saints; and the kingdome without the one in the heart, the other in the Church; they are both ſpirituall.</p>
            <p n="1">1 Chriſt rules and reignes <hi>in</hi> the Saints; the kingdom of God is within you: beloved, Chriſt hath a kingdom within you, if ye are his; <hi>Chriſt is in you except yee be reprobates,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.5. And this is a priviledge more then all the Kings in the earth have, they may reign here over their ſubjects, but not in them: but Chriſt firſt reigns <hi>in</hi> them, &amp; then <hi>over</hi> them: he reigns I mean ſpiritually <hi>over</hi> none; but thoſe <hi>in</hi> whom he reigns.</p>
            <p>Now Chriſt reigns in the ſouls of the Saints; firſt oppoſing all things that are contrary to himſelf: there are other Lords that will ſeeke to rule in the hearts of the Saints, if Chriſt ſubdue them not: the Devill hee will ſeek to be Lord, (he that is the God of the world, and rules and reigns in the hearts of the children of diſobedience) where Chriſt doth not rule; but when the Lord Jeſus coms he diſpoſſeſſeth him, and caſts him out, and ſo keeps him out. The Devill will make many a ſtrong aſſault, throw many a fiery dart at the ſoule of the Chriſtian, endevouring if poſſible hee can to
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:119599:111"/>ſhake his hold; but Chriſt he is the King, hee is the watchman, the keeper of Iſrael, hee gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth in power to the weak fainting ſoul, to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vercome all thoſe Laws and Edicts, Satan ſhal endevour to ſet up in the ſoule; ſo that now the Chriſtian eſpyes all Satans plots and arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiall devices to trap and enſnare him, rejects all his temptations, and ſays as Chriſt, <hi>Get thee behind me Satan:</hi> when the Devill acts and works in others, he hath no power over the ſoule where Chriſt reigns: it is true hee may throw in his darts, ſometimes make aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſays eyther to tempt to ſome evill, or to ſhake the faith of Chriſtians, but Chriſt the King reigns there ſtill, conquers him, ſubdues him, and ſo caries on his own work, that the gates of hell cannot prevail againſt that ſoul where he dwels. Thus Chriſt reigns keeping under Satan, beleeve it, beloved Chriſt and Satan cannot reign both in one ſoul.</p>
            <p n="2">2 Chriſt oppoſes the power of ſin in the ſoul, where he reigns: ſin bears a ſtrong ſway in the ſoul, now Chriſt he oppoſeth it; ſets himſelfe againſt it: hence it is there is ſuch a ſtrong oppoſition between the fleſh and the ſpirit, that is, the ſpirit of Chriſt: <hi>the ſpirit Iuſting againſt the fleſh, &amp; the fleſh againſt the ſpirit, and theſe two are contrary each to other.</hi>
               <pb n="205" facs="tcp:119599:111"/>And thus the Lord Jeſus continues oppoſing of ſin, of the Iuſt and corruption that is in the hearts of the Saints.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Queſt.</hi> How doth Chriſt oppoſe ſin and Satan? for ſin is Satans work, 1 <hi>John</hi> 5.8. <hi>For this cauſe was the Son of God manifeſted, that he might destroy the work of the Devill.</hi> The work of the Devill is ſin, <hi>hee that committeth ſin is of the Devill,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> Chriſt deſtroys ſin, which is the Devils work, two ways.</p>
            <p n="1">1 Firſt, Chriſt he deſtroys the guilt of it, and that he did, in bearing both the ſin, guilt, and condemnation of it upon his own body, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.24. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.3. and now he comes, and in the Goſpel makes it known unto his people, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.11.</p>
            <p n="2">2 Hee deſtroyes the power of it by his ſpirit, by the operation of his power, work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, reigning, and ruling in the hearts of his people: <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.4. Now Chriſt ſubdues this iniquity by his Kingly Office, reigning in the Saints; <hi>Ye are not under the law but under grace,</hi> under Chriſt, in whom was manifeſted the fulneſſe of grace.</p>
            <p>This doth Chriſt two ways: firſt, he comes to the ſoule of a poore ſinner, diſcovering his excellency, the riches of his grace, and ſo ſhed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:119599:112"/>abroad his love in the heart, gets the ſoule willing to receive him out of love unto him, deſires to have Chriſt ſet up, and his Kingdome within it ſelfe: for Chriſt hath ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver a Kingdome in the heart of man, till hee thus comes and breaks in upon the ſoul, diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering love: yet now ſayth the ſoul, let Chriſt be King, and none but him: although it is true, it is by his power he breaks in upon, and ſubdues the ſtout ſpirit of man, who would not willingly ſubmit of himſelfe, yet Chriſt makes him willing, by the ſhedding abroad of his love in the heart, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.5. So that now, the Lord Jeſus with the free conſent of the gracious ſoul, ſets up his kingdome in the heart, ſo that when Chriſt ſayth, <hi>My Sou give me my heart:</hi> Lord, take my heart, ſayth the ſoule, dwell there, rule there, ſer up thy kingdome there: ſo that you ſee Chriſt doth not rule as Tyrant in the ſouls of his people, but with the free and full conſent of the mind of the perſon in whom hee reigns, for this is both the wiſdome and power of Chriſt, that hee makes his people <hi>a willing people, Pſal.</hi> 110.3.</p>
            <p>Then ſecondly, Chriſt having purged the heart of man in ſome meaſure, overcomes thoſe ſtrong luſts and affections, and makes it
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:119599:112"/>a meet manſion houſe, a Temple for his holy ſpirit to dwell in: he then ſets up laws and ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes in the hearts of his children, in his king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome; and there he rules, oppoſing all other laws, for there are, and will be, the ſtirring of corruption, and that very ſtrongly too.</p>
            <p>Now Chriſt firſt ſets up the law of <hi>faith</hi> in the hearts of his people, and that in oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of infidelity: for naturally the Saints are ſubject to infidelity, through the motions of corruptions, and temptations of Satan. The beleeving ſoule, when it ſees, what a baſe na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture it ſtill carries about within it ſelfe, being ſenſible of the ſtirring of luſts and corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, Satan helping ſeriouſly, then it is trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled; O this evill nature of mine, ſayth the ſoul, <hi>who ſhall deliver me from this body of ſin?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now the law of Chriſt is to <hi>beleeve,</hi> and in this condition to live by believing: and ſo Chriſt enables to put faith in exerciſe, and to beleeve above hope, almoſt as <hi>Abraham;</hi> and ſo hee ſtill quiets the ſoule by enabling it to believe conſtantly in the name of the Sonne God; and that when it cannot worke, for hee is the Prince of our faith, the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour and finiſher of it: and ſo here is in the heart of the Chriſtian a ſtrong conflict between the law of faith, and the law of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidelity;
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:119599:113"/>the ſpirit of faith and the ſpirit of infidelity: infidelity it comes in with a mighty commanding authority upon the ſoule of that Chriſtian, ſet on by the Devils malice, and perhaps, ſometimes ſeemes almoſt in the eyes of reaſon to get the victory over faith; but then Chriſt (who maintaines his laws, puts them in execution) ariſes and rayſeth up the heart above thoſe doubtings and caries on the ſoul in a way of beleeving ſtill, and ſo quaſhes infidelity, and treads it under fect, and leaves it dead, executed for preſent by the law of faith.</p>
            <p n="2">2 Chriſt ſets up the law of love in his Kingdome, I mean in the heart of the Saints; and that in oppoſition to hatred. For the truth is, that every ſoul in whom Chriſt reigns not, doth indeed hate Chriſt: now Chriſt ſets up this law of love in the hearts of the Saints: love to himſelf, to his holineſſe, to his Goſpell, Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances, Saints, every thing, that have the name of Chriſt ſtampt upon them: it loves it for his ſake, and this law of love oppoſeth ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred, for there may come ſometimes, hard thoughts into the ſouls of the Saints under afflictions, and fiery tryals, ready perhaps, to ſay with <hi>David, Hath the Lord forgotten to be mercifull? hath he ſhut up his tender mercy in disple aſure?</hi> Now the law of love comes
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:119599:113"/>in, and helps the ſoule to ſee that there, is in Chriſt nothing but love to it, notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſouls preſent apprehenſions, and ſees all things ſhall worke for good to them that love the Lord; and ſo can ſay with the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, <hi>Lord, out of very love haſt thou afflicted me:</hi> and ſo the ſoule is knit to Chriſt in all conditions, &amp; cannot but have high thoughts of him, even then, when it ſuffers either <hi>for him</hi> or <hi>from him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>For him,</hi> That is, for want of the enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the manifeſtations of his pleaſing countenance, and the freſh incomes of his love, <hi>the kiſſings of his mouth, Cant.</hi> 1.2. or for the bearing up of his name in a viſible profeſſion of the Goſpel of Chriſt.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>From him,</hi> Fatherly chaſtiſements out of love, to make us partakers of his holineſſe, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.10. In all theſe ſufferings, when per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps ſomtimes the carnall part is ready al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt to quarrell againſt Chriſt, this law of love quells and ſubdues all, brings this heart-riſing in ſubjection, and knits the ſoule to the Lord Jeſus</p>
            <p n="2">2 As it cauſeth the ſoule to love the Lord Jeſus ſo it cauſeth it to love all that is Chriſts, and highly to eſteem of it: it oppoſes any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Law that may ſeeme to ariſe; as ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:119599:114"/>perhaps through the workings of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan, with the corruptions of the Saints, there may be ſome beginnings of ſlighting the Saints, of entertaining hard thoughts of them, but then Chriſt ſtirs up, and revives this Law of love in them, kills that hatred, thoſe hard thoughts, that it was apt to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive againſt them, and ſo knits the ſoule to them by a more firme united love then ever, and thus this law of love, overcomes this law of hatred: in a word, it cauſeth the Saints to doe all that they doe out of love, <hi>the love of Chriſt conſtr ains them,</hi> 2 Cor. 5.14.</p>
            <p n="3">3 Chriſt ſets up in his Kingdome the Law of meekneſſe and humility, and that in oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition to the Law of pride and vaineglory, <hi>Learn of me,</hi> ſayth Chriſt, <hi>for I am meeke and lowly in heart, Mat.</hi> 11.29. and this Chriſt ſets up in the hearts of his people, for he makes them partakers of his own graces, <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.16. it is a fruit of the Spirit, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.23. and of the Law of Chriſt, ſet up in the ſoules of the Saints, againſt which there is no law can prevail. It is true, there will be a ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing ſomtimes in the ſpirits of the Saints, pride will thruſt it ſelfe in, and be ready to life up the creature in the apprehenſion of ſome ſelfe excellencie, although there is no
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:119599:114"/>cauſe, yet this is a truth, I believe it, thoſe that have any experience of the Kingdome of Chriſt, or of the working of corruption know it right well, pride will be pirking in, &amp; ready to lift up the creature above meaſure, either ſomtimes Externally, &amp; to make a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference betwixt himſelfe and others, as nobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of birth, parents or kinted, honour in the world, Externall carnall excellencies: O how will it worke ſomtimes upon the heart of a poore creature, as if he were ſombody above others? O is not thy ſoule ſenſible of this ſomtimes dear Chriſtian? I cannot but think it is: But then comes in Chriſt; with his law of meekneſſe, of humility, and puls down this pride of heart, and lays it low, and brings the ſoule again to lay all in the duſt: what is honour ſayth the believing ſoule? what is nobility of birth? this is my honour, that I am a ſonne, a daughter, of Ieſus Chriſt, and ſo the ſoule comes down, ready to doe any ſervice of love to the meaneſt Saint, and now the Saints come to ſerve one another in love, and now they come again to ſee that they are all one in Chriſt Ieſus.</p>
            <p>Somtimes Internally, or with relation to Internall gifts received, although we have nothing but what we receive, yet this is the
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:119599:115"/>baſeneſſe of mans nature, it wil grow proude, be ready to be lifted up, even with thoſe gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces received, is it not ſo with thy heart? art thou not naturally proude? doth it not preſſe in upon thee ſomtimes? I know it doth, and I dare ſay it troubles thee that art a Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an: But now Chriſt comes with his law, and caſts all down to the ground, lays low thoſe mountains, thoſe ſtrong luſts that exalt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves thus againſt the Kingdome of Chriſt, for this pride is, abſolutely againſt the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of Chriſt, he will not have ſuch things in his Kingdom, it will thruſt it ſelfe in, but the Law of Chriſt diſcovers it, and vanquiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth it, and keeps the ſoule in an humble, low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, meeke condition. O conſider of it, where pride, domineers and rules, Chriſt hath no Kingdome in that ſoule, there Chriſt dwels, there he reigns, where he hath made the ſoule humble: faith in Chriſt doth not make men proud and high, no, no, it is the greateſt ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my to it in the world, a proud heart did never, can never believe, before brought low in the ſenſe of its own nothingneſſe, and emptyneſſe.</p>
            <p n="4">4 Chriſt ſets up in the hearts of his Saints in his Kingdom, the law of patience and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentedneſſe, in oppoſition to anger, impatien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, and diſcontentedneſſe.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="213" facs="tcp:119599:115"/>
Raſh anger, impatiencic, peeviſhneſſe of ſpirit, how will they ariſe and be ſtriving ſomtimes in the hearts of Chriſtians for a ſmall matter? how will the heart be out of order and diſtemper? what words will be ready to flow forth, the heart being in this temper? but now in the heart of a Chriſtian, Chriſt puts in execution his law of patience and quietneſſe of ſpirit. O ſayth Chriſt to the ſoule, thou muſt be patient and meeke, thou muſt learn of me, didſt thou ever read that I was moved to anger, and impatiencie, to fret and fume? no, not againſt mine ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies: and then ſayth the ſoule, ô what a fool am I thus to fret, and then to be angry? how unlike to Chriſt am I? and then down coms that proud peeviſh ſpirit into the duſt, and <hi>ſo fooliſh was I and ignorant, I was even a beaſt before thee:</hi> and then the ſoule is turned again into a ſweet diſpoſition of love, a compound of patience, not eaſily pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked, not eaſily again ſtirred to wrath.</p>
            <p>Somtimes in the ſoule of a Chriſtian is apt to ariſe perhaps ſome impatiencie and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contentedneſſe under afflictions and perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, hardly can it bear with patience, ſome heart riſing this way may ariſe: but then in comes Chriſt purting in execution the Law
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:119599:116"/>of patience and contentedneſſe, and puls downe all thoſe impatient diſcontented thoughts, and then let patience have her per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect worke, and the ſoule is quieted and contented, and willingly ſubmits unto the minde of Jeſus, and then it can ſay with the Apoſtle <hi>Paul,</hi> Phil. 4.11. <hi>I have learn'd in what eſtate ſoever I am, therewith to bee content,</hi> and now the ſoule is quieted, and waits patiently upon the Lord, and now the ſoule ſayth, ô how unlike am I to Chriſt 3 he ſuffered (meekly as a lamb dumb before the ſhearer, and opened not his mouth) for me a ſinner, he ſuffered for me, the juſt for the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt, that hee might bring me to God, and ſhall not I be contented to ſuffer reproach and ſhame for him, and then come what will come, patience poſſeſſeth the ſoule.</p>
            <p n="5">5 Chriſt ſets up the Law of heavenly mindedneſſe in the heart of a Chriſtian, and indeed it is no wonder, for his Kingdom is there, heaven is there, <hi>The Kingdome of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven is within you, Luke,</hi> 17.21. and therefore needs muſt Chriſt ſet up this Law in his Kingdome, and that in oppoſition to earthly mindedneſſe, ſinfulneſſe, or any thing that is oppoſite to holyneſſe and heavenlyneſſe; and you know how the ſpirits of men, nay,
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:119599:116"/>of Chriſtians, are apt to be below the Lord Jeſus: ſomtimes on earthly object; ſomtimes, vaine, proud, unprofitable things run in the mind, but Chriſt he comes, and ſcatters thoſe low things, and raiſeth the heart to himſelfe, and keeps the heart in ſuch a temper, that nothing can ſatisfie it but himſelf, and when it loſeth its heavenly temper, its heavenly glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, it is preſently troubled, and it cannot poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly take comfort in any thing beneath the Lord Jeſus: and here is a continuall combat and conflict between the fleſh and the ſpirit, the corrupt nature and the divine nature; and certainly here corruption and Satan, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nytimes brings ſadneſſe upon the ſpirits of the Saints, in darkning, in overſhadowing their heavenly enjoyment, I meane in way of ſenſe, although they can never ſhake the faith of the ſoule in whom Chriſt dwels, <hi>Mat.</hi> 16. <hi>The gates of Hell ſhall not prevaile a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt it.</hi>

            <p>Conſider now, doe you finde Chriſts King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, Chriſts laws, theſe ſet up in your hearts? do you find Chriſt oppoſing luſt and corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on within you, or do you not? If Chriſt be there, you will finde it in ſome meaſure: I confeſſe it, that Chriſt according to his diverſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of operations and workings, keeps this
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:119599:117"/>law of ſin under in ſome ſouls more then in other, both the workings of it, and the guilt of it, <hi>Rom</hi> 8.2. <hi>The law of the ſpirit of life, hath made free from the law of ſin and death:</hi> that is free from the power, as it comes with authority, as a law; there Chriſt ſubdues, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it wil be there as a rebel reigning, yet it ſhal ſet up no law in the ſoul where Chriſt is. Conſider of it you that were never troubled about your ſins, but all things are at peace within you: it is a ſad ſigne Chriſt hath not ſet up his Kingdome there: <hi>While the ſtrong man</hi> (the Devill) <hi>keeps the houſe, all things are at peace,</hi> all quiet, and ſo the poore creature lives in a fools Paradiſe, and plcaſes himſelf in this condition, but beleeve it when the Lord Jeſus comes, <hi>He will ſit as a refiner, and as a purifier, hee will purge out the droſſe when hee comes:</hi> Mal. 3.3. <hi>But who may abide the day of his comming, he will come with the refiners fire, and the fullers ſope,</hi> he comes not to bring peace, that is, with luſt and corruption, but the Lord cuts them downe: corruption dyes when Chriſt comes.</p>
            <p>

<pb n="217" facs="tcp:119599:117"/>of Chriſt, ſet up in my ſoule, or from ſome other principle?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> There is a conflict betweene the law and naturall conſcience, and there is a conflict between the ſpirit of Chriſt, his work in the ſpirit of the Chriſtian, and the fleſh corrupt nature and Satan.</p>
            <p n="1">1 There is a conflict betweene naturall conſcience, and the law, or the minde legally enlightned and the law: and this may be in a naturall man or an Hypocrite. Thus it was with <hi>Judas, I have ſinned in betraying the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent bloud.</hi> He ſaw his ſin, he had tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the law, and now hee is troubled, not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of his ſin, as it was a ſin, but becauſe his conſcience now dogs him, will not let him reſt. This conflict may be in the heart of a poor creature, and Chriſt never come there in the way of mercy; and the ſoule deceive and cozen it ſelf, thinking Chriſt is their oppoſing ſin, when it is nothing elſe, but the minde of man legally enlightned, apprehending wrath, and anger, from the breach of the law: and now walks more circumſpectly yeelds more perfectobedience, oppoſes ſin, as a tranſgreſſion of the law, and ſo thinks it ſelfe in a goodly paradiſe, in a fair way for heaven. And thus many poor ſouls deceive themſelves and undo their ſouls everlaſtingly.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="218" facs="tcp:119599:118"/>
But perhaps ſome may ſay, how ſhall I know the difference between mine one oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing ſin, from a principall of legall light? whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the conflict be betweene naturall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience and the law? or the Kingdome of Chriſt ſet up in my ſoule, and ſin?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> The conflict betweene naturall conſcience and the law, it is only from the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion of the condemnation of the Law: the law ſaith, <hi>thou ſhalt not ſin;</hi> if thou do'ſt it, thou muſt ſuffer, thou muſt be condemned: conſcience enlightned, ſeeing this is caſt down, and perhaps is much perplexed for ſin; ſets againſt ſin, oppoſeth it with might and mayn, and reſolves to ſin no more: and anon ſin preſents it ſelf, and the Law preſents it ſelf, and then out of doors ſin muſt: but why? becauſe of the law, not becauſe of Chriſt: the law will give it no reſt, no peace there? now to illuſtrate this by a compariſon in theſe days of war; I do not queſtion, but there are many in this countrey that are turned Palia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menteers for feare leſt the Law ſeize upon their goods and perſons, and ſo they looſe all: their mindes are ſo far enlightned, that they ſee it is good to ſleepe in a whole skin as they ſay, and hence they can perhaps talk ſomtimes, and do for the Parliament, when indeed their
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:119599:118"/>mindes are contrary: well, there comes one whoſe minde is not ſo farre enlightned as to ſeeke their owne externall good, while he is here, one whom this man loves, and could gladly entertain him; but for fear of the law he ſhall be counted and taken for an enemy to the State; out of doores this man go; none dares entertain him: but why? not for want of love, but for feare: beloved I have known the truth of this on the otherſide enow.</p>
            <p>And thus it is with this man, perhaps the poore creature could be content to entertaine ſinne in his boſome, luſt, anger, pride, &amp;c. but no ſooner doth ſin appeare, but the law that appeares, conſcience that is troubled, out muſt the ſin, elſe conſcience cannot be quier: and ſo (beloved) for the quietneſſe of conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, who fears eternall flames, <hi>Eſay</hi> 33.14. out ſin muſt and an externall conformity fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, and ſo the man is become a Chriſtian. It is as a man that hath a loving friend, hee brings him to his houfe, but the wife will not be ſatisfied, ſhe ſcolds, out muſt the man, elſe there will be no peace: ſo ſin would finde welcome, perhaps, and kinde entertainment with the man, but naturall conſcience from the apprehenſion of the law, ſcolds and threa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tens, and out muſt the beloved luſt, elſe there
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:119599:119"/>will be no peace. I feare mee many a poore ſoule ſplit themſelves upon this rock.</p>
            <p>But when Chriſt comes and ſets up his Kingdome in the ſoul, he preſently writes his law in the heart, makes them partakers of the divine nature, makes them awilling people: and now the conflict is not between the mind and the law, but between the ſpirit and ſin: were there no law, that matters not with the gracious ſoule, it ſees ſuch a great diſpropor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and diſtance betweene its beloved, and ſin, that there ariſeth a bitter enmity between ſin and the law of love, in the ſoule of the Saints; that the every appearance, the very motions of ſin, as it is ſin, not as it brings condemnation, but as it is filthy, polluting, contrary to the minde of Chriſt. O the ſoule hath a continuall loathing of it, and thus hee that is born of God ſinneth not, gives not the leaſt allowance to ſin, in the very thought; the very thought of it is bitter.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Quest.</hi> But what are the effects of this Kingdom of Chriſt in the ſouls of the Saints?</p>
            <p>

Therefore if any Church or Magiſtrate would exerciſe that power they conceive Chriſt hath entruſted them in, about ſpirituall Church affaires, I humbly conceive that they have nothing to do with thoſe that are not of the ſame body with them, or the ſame ſociety, as many Churches may be in ſociety: but thoſe that are

The Church of Chriſt, his kingdom, they are ſuch as are in the order and fellowſhip of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, compacted together, according to the Goſpel rule, in order and fellowſhip: it is in the ſpirituall kingdome of Chriſt in this caſe, as in the body politick: the whole kingdome under one governme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t is but one body politick, or ſtate: ſo the Kingdom of Chriſt, his church, although gathered in many bodies, yet it is but one body, and every body hath the ſame power, the ſame priviledges, ſo that it ought to be a body compacted together, under the reign and rule of one Lord leſus, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4.16. and the externall way, by which the Saints enter into this fellow ſhip, it is by baptiſme, as you may ſee, <hi>Acts</hi> 2.41. <hi>Then they with the godly received the word, and were baptized,</hi> and ſo added, but I have ſpoken of this formerly, and therefore I paſſe it here.</p>
            <p n="2">2 As Chriſt hath a Kingdom, and that is ſpirituall, in relation to the matter, ſo he ſets up Laws and they are ſpirituall, the Laws

            <list>

            <p n="1">1 The law of love, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.13, 14. <hi>By love ſerve one another, for all the Law is fulfilled in one word, even this, Thou ſhalt love thy neighbour as thy ſelfe,</hi> and <hi>Jam.</hi> 2.8. It is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, <hi>the royall Law of God, Thou ſhalt love thy neighbonr as thyſelfe,</hi> this is the Law of the Goſpel, love to Chriſt, and love to the Saints. <hi>A new commandement give I unto you, that yee love one another, Joh.</hi> 13.34. Now this love breaks forth in cauſing the Saints to walke up according to every rule of the Goſpel, it conſtrains them to ſubmit to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very word, to every comand of Chriſt, it cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth the Saints to watch over each other, to <hi>build up each other in the moſt holy faith,</hi> to <hi>reſtore a weak brother with the ſpirit of meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, being falne,</hi> Gal. 6.1. <hi>to beare one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers burthens, and ſo to fulfill the Law of CHRIST:</hi> Thus CHRIST rules in and over his Kingdom, by this law of love, It is <hi>the end of the command of the Goſpel, love out of a pure heart and faith unfained,</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.5. He gives rules unto his people, out of love, he cauſeth them to obey out of love, there is no condemnation in his law
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:119599:124"/>to his people, but if <hi>they ſin, they have an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocate with the Father, Jeſus Chriſt the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous,</hi> 1 Joh. 2.1. <hi>who is a propitiation for their ſins.</hi> Here is love in the King, love in the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, love in Chriſt commanding, love in Chriſtians obeying, a Kingdom upheld and maintained by the law of love. O that the God of love would increaſe this love more abundaritly, both in your and my ſoul, 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 3.12. The Lord make you to abound in love one towards another, and to wards all men. O this love is ſweet, amiable, pleaſant, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 133.1. love to the Saints, love to all men, it is the way to win them to the Lord Jeſus, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.25. This is the main law by which Chriſt rules <hi>in</hi> and <hi>over</hi> his Saints, his Churches, his Kingdom: and this is ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall.</p>
            <p n="2">2 There is the law of edification, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14.26. <hi>Let all things be done to edifying.</hi> It is the law of Chriſt in his Church, that all things ſhould be done to edification, for the building up of the Saints in their moſt holy faith, therefore the Apoſtle 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.23. makes light of that which tends not to edifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, <hi>All things are lawfull for me, but all things edifie not,</hi> that is it which a Chriſtian ſhould looke moſt unto, that is it that will
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:119599:124"/>edifie moſt: it is the end of their compacting and building together in faith and fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, that they might edifie each other in love, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4.16 <hi>All done in the Church is for the edification of the body,</hi> or ſhould be: every Ordinance that Chriſt hath ſet up in his Kingdom is for Edification; Watching over each other, Exhortation, Admonition, it is all for edification: Baptiſme, Preaching, the Supper of the Lord, Communion and fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, it is all for edification, and conſolation, as Chriſt hath appointed it, <hi>Act.</hi> 2.41. to 46. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14.3. Church cenſure, excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, it is an Ordinance appointed of God for edification, to bring the ſinner into the ſight of his ſinne, and that ſhould bee the Churches end in the uſe of it: <hi>Give him up to Satan for the deſtruction of the fleſh, that the ſoule might be ſaved in the day of the Lord Jeſus.</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.5. that is the end of this ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, and ſhould be the Churches end in the execution of it, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 16.22. <hi>If any man love not the Lord Jeſus, let him be Anathema Maranatha,</hi> let him be accurſed till the Lord come, ſo the word <hi>Maranatha</hi> implies: it conſiſts of two Syrian words, <hi>Maran</hi> out Lord, <hi>Atha</hi> come, till our Lord come.</p>
            <p>That is, as I underſtand it, till the Lord
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:119599:125"/>come, either in a way of love convincing him by this ordinance, or to judge and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne him, ſo that other Scripture ſeems to imply, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.5. <hi>That his ſoule may be ſaved in the day of the Lord Jeſus,</hi> the day Jeſus comes in to doe good unto him, for when e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the Lord Jeſus takes an oportunity to doe good to a ſinner, that is the day of the Lord, or the Lords day, when he manifeſts mercie, ſee <hi>Pſal.</hi> 110.3. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.2.</p>
            <p>Thus Chriſt rules by his Law generally in the Aſſembly of Saints: But</p>

<pb n="233" facs="tcp:119599:125"/>to his Church, wherein his Kingly office appears?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſwer.</hi> Hee hath given power to his Church.</p>

               </item>
            </list>
            <p n="1">1 To <hi>Iudge,</hi> and this under a twofold con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration, 1 Of the faith of members that are to be received. 2 Of proceedings within the ſame body.</p>
            <p n="1">1 Of the faith of members that are to bee admitted: This belongs to the Church, or ſome appointed thereunto by the Church: For if faith be required of thoſe that are to be admitted, then faith is to be manifeſted in thoſe received, to thoſe that receive it, this is a truth generally held forth in Scripture, <hi>Act.</hi> 2.38. with the 41. and <hi>Act.</hi> 8.37. and 19.17, 18. And likewiſe there ſeems to bee ſomthing to this purpoſe in that Scripture, <hi>Mat.</hi> 16.19. <hi>I will give unto thee the keyes of the Kingdom of heaven, and whatſoever thou ſhalt binde on earth, ſhall be bound in heaven:</hi> Whatſoever the Church of Chriſt concludes on on earth, is approved of in heaven, while they walke according to rule, although I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:119599:126"/>the great myſtry couched under theſe words is another thing, to wit, the power Chriſt gives to the faith of <hi>Peter,</hi> &amp; all that ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain like precious faith: whatſoever is bound on earth (that is, whoſoever believes on earth) that is, bound in heaven: whoſoever believeth not on earth looſeth all, it is looſed in heaven: for it is to <hi>Peters</hi> faith Chriſt commits the keyes</p>
            <p n="2">2 There is power to judge of things in the Church, and this every member ought to make uſe of in looking to the wayes of each other, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.4. <hi>Look not every one to his own things, but every one to the things of one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, Mat.</hi> 18.17, 18. Thus all the body ought to watch over each other, and to judge the actions of each other, thus the Elder is to watch over the body, and to judge the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, and to reprove, rebuke, exhort, with patience and love where is occaſion: and thus may, nay, and ought, the whole Church to watch over (and if occaſion be) reprove, admoniſh, &amp;c. the Elder. Thus is the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly office of Chriſt, carryed along ſweeetly in the Church of Chriſt, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5.19, 20. When all watch over each other, when all are ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject each to other. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5.5.</p>
            <p n="2">2 Chriſt hath given power, as to Judge,
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:119599:126"/>ſo to <hi>Determine</hi> of things, and this for the good of the body, for the order of the Church of Chriſt,</p>
            <p n="3">3 And alſo It, <hi>to paſſe ſentence</hi> (I mean) ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall, by way of excommunication, as you heard before. I conceive the Church and ſtate of the Jews, who was <hi>Abrahams</hi> natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall ſeed, was a type of the Church of the Goſpel, the ſpirituall ſeed of Chriſt, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.26. They had laws and ſtatutes, ſo hath the Church of Chriſt now, onely theirs carnall, ours ſpirituall: for that Church was more carnall then Spirituall, for that was the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall ſeed, this the ſpirituall: they were to admit none but thoſe that were naturally or bodily circumciſed, we none but thoſe that are ſpirituall, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2. <hi>ult.</hi> They were not to touch any thing, whereupon was any exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall uncleanneſſe, wee are not to touch the ſpirituall unclean thing, that is Sin, or ſinfull worſhips or fellowſhips, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.15, 16, 17. They were to put offenders that were groſſe to death bodily, the Church of Chriſt ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually by excommunication: Thus is the Kingly office of Chriſt carried along in the Kingdom, in the Church of Chriſt under the Goſpel, and you ſee both Church and Laws are ſpirituall.</p>
            <p n="3">
               <pb n="236" facs="tcp:119599:127"/>
3 The executions of the Churches Laws are ſpirituall, but this I have opened alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy in my foregoing diſcourſe, therefore I paſſe.</p>
            <p n="4">4 The ends of it are ſpirituall, namely, as you have heard.</p>
            <p n="1">1 The good of the body, the edifying of the body of Chriſt, ſee <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4.11. And</p>
            <p n="2">2 The glory of Jeſus, the execution of the Laws of Chriſt, as it tends to the Saints good, ſo Chriſts glory, <hi>Yee call me Lord</hi> (ſayth Chriſt) <hi>but where is mine honour?</hi> This ſhould be the end, as of all the Saints Church actions, ſo of all civill actions, <hi>the glory of God,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.23.</p>
            <p>Thus you ſee Chriſt is King, and he hath a ſpirituall Kingdome, and he rules by his Scepter in this Kingdom, and there is good reaſon for it.</p>
            <p n="1">1 He was borne King, he hath a right to it by birth, it is his birthright, <hi>Mat.</hi> 2.2. <hi>Where is he that is borne King of the Iews? He is a Iew that is one inwardly,</hi> and it is Chriſts birthright to reigne over them, and thoſe who take the rule, the Kingdom from Chriſt, are no leſſe then enemies and traitors to the royall crowne and dignity of the Lord Jeſus: and he will take them alive one day, and caſt
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:119599:127"/>them into the lake of fire: <hi>Revel.</hi> 19.20.</p>
            <p n="2">2 He is thereunto appointed by the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: <hi>God the Father hath committed all judgement to the Sonne,</hi> Iohn 10.22. <hi>For the Father judgeth no man, but hath committed all judgement to the Son, ver.</hi> 27. And hee hath given him authority to execute judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, becauſe he is the Son of God. God the father hath given up the Kingdom to the Son, and all government, rule and dominion, is in the hand of Chriſt, as he is man as well as God, <hi>Act.</hi> 17.31. He hath appointed a day in which he will judge the World, by that man whom he hath ordained, <hi>Mat.</hi> 28.18. <hi>All power is given to me, both in heaven and in earth, &amp;c.</hi> Thus you ſee, power and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority is given to the Lord Jeſus, and he is to exerciſe it, and not man, farther then hee hath appointed, for the good of his Church.</p>
            <p n="3">3 He hath purchaſed this Kingdom with his own bloud, and therefore good reaſon he ſhould reigne in it and over it: <hi>Act.</hi> 20.28. <hi>He hath purchaſed his Church with his own bloud:</hi> is it not reaſon then that Chriſt ſhould reigne over thoſe whom he hath purchaſed? thoſe who were loſt and undone, children of wrath as well as others, Chriſt having re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed them out of the hands of all their
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:119599:128"/>enemies, and now rules-over them in love for their good, the end wherefore he hath ſaved them, <hi>That he might have a people to ſerve him in holineſſe and righteouſneſſe, Luke</hi> 1.74.75. So that the Saints are not their own, <hi>They are bought with a price,</hi> 1 Cor. 6.19, 20. <hi>Therefore glorifie God in your bodies, and in your ſpirits, which are Gods:</hi> They are Gods own by purchaſe, and he purchaſed them, <hi>That they which live ſhould not henceforth live unto themſelves, but unto him that dyed for them, and roſe again,</hi> 2 Cor. 10.11. Thus you ſee there is good reaſon that Chriſt ſhould be King of Saints: <hi>He was borne to it, He is thereunto appointed, He hath purchaſed them for that end and purpoſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Uſe</hi> A word of information; if it be ſo that Chriſt be the King of his people, and he alone ought to rule in all ſpirituall things, then</p>
            <p n="1">1 Thoſe that get in to the throne of Chriſt, &amp; beare rule where Chriſt ſhould, are no friends to him. He, who ever he be, <hi>That exalts him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe above all that is called God, and ſits in the ſeat of God,</hi> is the Antichriſt, 2 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 2.4, 8. <hi>Whom Chriſt will take as his enemy, and deſtroy him with the breath of his mouth, and the brightneſſe of his comming.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2 Thoſe are enemies, who will not have
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:119599:128"/>Chriſt to reign over them, who reſolve to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to the power of man in the things of God: they are no friends to Chriſt, but enemies, and ſo he will take them, and ſo he will deal with them. <hi>Luke</hi> 19, 27. <hi>But thoſe mine enemies which would not that I ſhould reign over them, bring them hither and ſlay them before mee, &amp;c. Acts</hi> 3.23. <hi>And he that will not he are this Prophet ſhall be cut off from amongst his people.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3 If the kingdom of Chriſt be ſpirituall, not of this World, then thoſe are no friends to Chriſt, that turn the World into Church; I mean, by a humane Law and Ordinance. Let men turn the World into Church by preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as faſt as they can, or as Chriſt <hi>will,</hi> but to compell all, to bring in, earthly, ignorant, car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall men into the Church of Chriſt, is not as according to the mind of Chriſt, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 44.7. to the 14. and this is none of Chriſts Church, but the Synagogue of Satan; the World, and not the Church. And truly I am apt to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, from that fore-mentioned Scripture that thoſe, that have been chiefe in this buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, who are godly amongſt them, ſhall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be honoured with doing much in the work of God; but they ſhal come in laſt, they ſhall be the meaneſt, and the loweſt; I mean with relation to gifts in the houſe of God.
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:119599:129"/>This may ſeeme ſtrange to ſome, but a truth: for God will have none to glory in their own preſent gifts or excellency, but that hee that gloryeth may glory in the Lord.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Uſe</hi> 2. If the Kingdome of Chriſt be ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall, then here is a word of exhortation, to ſtirre up ſpirituall people, ſpirituall men and women, to ſubmit to Chriſt, to come under the government of Chriſt, to walk with, to have fellowſhip with the ſpirituall people of Chriſt. Beloved, it is a ſad thing to ſee ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall people, to walk with the World, to joyn in the Worlds fellowſhip, in the Worlds worſhip, <hi>What communion hath light with darkneſſe? What fellowſhip hath Chriſt with Beliall? What part hath the believer with the unbeliever?</hi> ô that the exhortation might take place in your ſouls, <hi>Come out from amongst them, and be yee ſeparate, and I will receive you.</hi> 2 Cor. 6.17. The Lords people are a ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly people, and the Lords ways are holy ways: <hi>Holineſſe becomes thy houſe, ô Lord, for ever.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Uſe</hi> 3. A word of conſolation and joy for the Saints, the Church, the kingdome of Chriſt: you have cauſe of joy, and cauſe of rejoycing. Firſt, that you have ſuch a king, a great king, above all gods; hee that is the Lord of Lords, and the king of kings: hee is
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:119599:129"/>our king, he is the king of Saints: the Saints have ſuch a king, who is able to defend them, able to ſave them from all their enemies: and he will ſave them, he is able to daſh all his and his Saints enemies in peeces, like a potters veſſell: and he will, he ſhall do it, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 2.9. <hi>Thou ſhalt break them with a rod of iron, and daſh them in peeces like a potters veſſel. Be wiſe now therefore, ô ye Kings, and be inſtructed yee judges of the earth, ſerve the Lord with fear, and rejoyce with trembling, kiſſe the Son leaſt he be angry, &amp;c.</hi> But let the Saints re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce in the Lord, let Iſrael rejoyce in him that made him, let the children of <hi>Sion</hi> be joyfull in their King, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 149.2.</p>
            <p n="2">2 The Saints have cauſe to rejoyce and to be comforted, they are all made Kings to the Lord. They are Kings and they ſhall reign, they reign already over ſin and luſt, over Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.12. <hi>Sin ſhall not have dominion over you:</hi> others are ſlaves to ſin and Satan, ſin reigns in, and over them, but the Saints reign over ſin, they have a Kingdom already within them, without them the Church, which is both Chriſts and the Saints King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, where Chriſt and the Chriſtian ſolace themſelves together, and they ſhall have a Kingdom although they are now rejected

They ſhall rule their enemies, thoſe that perhaps formerly have ruled them, <hi>Rev.</hi> 2.26, 27. <hi>To him that overcommeth, and keepeth my words to the end, to him will I give power over the Nations, and he ſhall rule them with a rod of iron, as the veſſels of a potter ſhall they be bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken</hi> to ſhivers, even as I received of my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: Thus Chriſt ſhall judge, thus the Saints ſhall judge, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 149.5, 6. A wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full comfort for the Saints, but a ſad word for the enemies both of Chriſt and Chriſtians, <hi>Let the Saints be joyfull in glory, let them ſing aloud upon their beds, let the high praiſes of God be in their mouthes, and a two edged ſword in their hand, to execute vengeance upon the Heathen, and puniſhment upon the people, to binde their Kings in chains, and their No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles in fetters of iron, to execute upon them the judgement written, this honour have all the Saints, praiſe the Lord:</hi> Thus the Saints are made Kings you ſee, and ſhall have domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and rule, and a Kingdom, although they are rejected and ſlighted, and counted the
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:119599:130"/>off-ſcouring of all things here, by the men of the world, yet they are Kings, and ſhall have a kingdom. A great joy for Chriſtians! <hi>Dan.</hi> 7.27. <hi>Luke</hi> 12.32.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, this ſhould ſtir up the Saints to walk humbly, to walk holily, as becommeth the ſubjects of the ſpirituall kingdome of Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt: that as Chriſt hath called them out of this world, ſo they ſhould no longer faſhion themſelves like unto this world, but walk as becomes Chriſtians, profeſſing god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lines, that the name of God be not blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med among the <hi>Gentiles.</hi> And likewiſe how doth it concern you who are members in the kingdom, the Church of Chriſt, to carry on the kingly office of Chriſt in his Church with majeſty, that ſo all things may be done in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, that ſo confuſion and diſorders may be avoided, and that every member in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar ſubmit to order: and for that end, to or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daine officers according to rule, the want whereof I conceive is one means of confuſion in the Churches, and cauſeth ſome to breake from all order: ſo much briefly concerning the offices of Chriſt. In all theſe he is <hi>to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alted now in the dayes of the Gospel, Mat.</hi> 28.18, 19, 20. <hi>Acts</hi> 3.22, 23.</p>
            <p>Now I come to my text, for the manner
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:119599:131"/>how he is to be exalted, as in the preaching of the Goſpel, and in the hearts of his people, in his offices, ſo in my text, <hi>Hee is to be exal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and lifted up even as</hi> Moſes <hi>lifted up the Serpent in the wilderneſſe.</hi> Now it is true, this might have ſome relation to his lifting up up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the croſſe, <hi>John</hi> 12.32, 33. and I, if I be lifted up, will draw all men unto mee: now <hi>John</hi> interprets it in the next verſe, <hi>this hee ſpake, ſignifying what death hee ſhould dye:</hi> ſo that Chriſt was lifted up upon the croſſe, <hi>chap.</hi> 8.28. ſo hee is ſtill to be lifted up, a dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, a crucified Chriſt for ſin.</p>
            <p>But he then was, and ſtill is to be lifted up as the Serpent was lifted up in the wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe. Firſt, there was the lifting up of the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent with the manner of it above all the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. 2 The cauſe of it, that whoſoever was bitten with the fiery Serpent, might look to this brazen Serpent and be cured.</p>
            <p n="1">1 The lifting up of the Serpent, with the manner of it, <hi>Numb.</hi> 21 8, 9. <hi>And the Lord ſaid unto</hi> Moſes, <hi>make thee a fiery Serpent, and ſet it upon a pole; and it ſhall come to paſſe, that every one that is bitten, when hee looketh upon it, hee ſhall live,</hi> verſe 9. <hi>And</hi> Moſes <hi>made a Serpent of braſſe, and put it up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a pole, and it came to paſſe, that if a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:119599:131"/>had bitten any man, he beheld the Serpent of braſſe and lived.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Here was the lifting up of the Serpent in the wilderneſs: he was lifted up, upon a pole above all the people, to the end that all that were bitten, might behold him: ſo Chriſt is to be lifted up, he is to be exalted above all, as the Serpent in the wilderneſſe; and that either <hi>in the world,</hi> or <hi>in the Church: in the World,</hi> ſo hee is to be exalted in the preaching of the Goſpel, in the view of all, above all, that ſo men may come to the view of him: and <hi>in the Church</hi> that ſo Chriſt may ſtill have the preheminence.</p>
            <p n="1">1 He is to be exalted above the world, or any creature: O how doth the world prevail amongſt men? nay, too much amongſt Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians: but where Chriſt comes, hee ſets the ſoul above the creature, 1 <hi>John.</hi> 5.4, 5. <hi>Whoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever is borne of God overcommeth the world, and this is the victory that overcommeth the world, even your faith, who is he that over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commeth the world, but he that believeth that Jeſus is the Son of God.</hi> It is the cleere ſight and apprehenſion of the Lord Jeſus, that ſets the ſoule above the world, the more the ſoule enjoys of Chriſt, the more it ſlights things below, thus Chriſt is to be lifted up, both in
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:119599:132"/>the preaching of the Goſpel, and in the hearts of the Saints.</p>
            <p n="2">2 Chriſt is to be lifted up above duties and all legall righteouſneſſe, thus the Apoſtle lifts up Chriſt, both in preaching and in his own ſoule: he preached Chriſt and him one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.1, 2. <hi>I deſire to know</hi> (that is to make known) <hi>nothing but Chriſt and him crucified:</hi> Chriſt as the alone juſtifier of all that believe, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.24. <hi>Being juſtified free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by his grace, through the redemption that is in Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> ſo that he is juſt, and the ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifier of all that believe in Jeſus, <hi>ver.</hi> 26. <hi>Chriſt is the end of the Law, for righteouſneſs to all that believe; Rom.</hi> 10.4. Chriſt juſtify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing believers from all things, from which they could not have been juſtified by the Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> act 13.39. and thus is Chriſt to be lifted up in the view of all, <hi>Mar.</hi> 16.16. <hi>God preach the Goſpel to every creature,</hi> and thus is Chriſt to be lifted up above all and every name, that is or may be named under hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, wherein men uſually reſt and deceive themſelves, for <hi>There is none other name gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven under heaven among men, whereby we may be ſaved,</hi> Act. 4.12.</p>
            <p n="2">2 In the hearts of the Saints, Chriſt is to be lifted up above all duties, legall righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:119599:132"/>or any thing that may be named: all in the ſoule of the Chriſtian is laid down as emptineſſe, nay, as dung and droſſe, at the feet of Chriſt, and the ſoule glories in no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe but Chriſt and him crucified; thus Chriſt is to be exalted and lifted up as upon a pole, as the brazen Serpent, above every thing or name, that may be named under heaven.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Queſt.</hi> What is the reaſon, that Chriſt is thus to be exalted?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1 Becauſe God hath exalted him and lifted him up for that end and purpoſe: <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.9. <hi>God hath highly exalted him, and given him a name, above every name, &amp;c.</hi> God hath given to Chriſt a high tranſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent name, a name above every name, the name of a <hi>Saviour,</hi> and there is no ſalvation to be attained without him: <hi>The deſire of all Nations, Hag.</hi> 2.7. That the deſire of all his people in every Nation might be to him, as the deſire of the wife to the husband: <hi>The King of his people,</hi> men may come, and bow and fall down, and worſhip before him. God the Father hath ſet him up as the enſigne to whom the Nations muſt come, <hi>Eſay</hi> 11.10. as the common Saviour and Gouernour of all Gods elect.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="248" facs="tcp:119599:133"/>
2 Chriſt is to be lifted up, that ſo men may have life by him, the ſerpent was lifted up, that whoſoever was bit with the fiery ſerpent might live, for the Lord ſent fiery ſerpents amongſt the Jews in the wilderneſs, for their ſins, as you may ſee, <hi>Numb.</hi> 2.6, 7. who bit them that they dyed, and this was the end, that whoſoever was bit with the fiery ſerpent might looke to the brazen Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent and live. Now I am apt to conceive, that the fiery ſerpent holds forth the Law, for I finde the Law called a <hi>fiery Law,</hi> Deut. 33.2. <hi>From his right hand went a firy Law:</hi> and the brazen Serpent holds forth Chriſt: Now as the fiery ſerpent did bite the children of Iſrael for their ſin in the wilderneſſe, ſo the Law who hath nothing but fire in it, bites men, and when they are bitten of the Law, they are to look to Jeſus.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> It ſeems then that the preaching of the Law, is that prepares for Ieſus.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Nay, it is not ſo, for although all men are under the law by nature, yet it is the preaching of the Goſpel that diſcovers it. I give you theſe grounds.</p>
            <p n="1">1 A man never ſavingly ſees his evill con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition without a Chriſt, but it is the ſpirit of God that diſcovers it unto him: this all that
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:119599:133"/>are ſound in the faith agree unto, then the preaching of the Law brings not this ſpirit, ſee <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.2. <hi>This onely would I learn of you</hi> (ſayth the Apoſtle, ſpeak out of your expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience) <hi>received yee the Spirit by the works of the Law, or by the hearing of faith?</hi> Beloved, God hath appointed his ſpirit to be the means in the preaching of the Goſpel, to convince the world of ſin, <hi>Iohn</hi> 16.9. It is the ſpirit of God that convinceth the world of ſin, and that in the preaching of faith, the Apoſtle <hi>was once alive without the Law,</hi> that is, without the ſpirituall underſtanding of the Law, <hi>but when the commandement came, ſin reigned, and I dyed:</hi> that is, when Chriſt had opened his eyes to ſee into the ſpirit of the Law, for you may ſee, <hi>Act.</hi> 9.4, 5, &amp;c. the miniſtry by which <hi>Paul</hi> comes to ſee himſelfe, is the voyce of Chriſt, <hi>I am Ieſus of Naze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth,</hi> then <hi>Paul</hi> comes trembling, &amp;c. ſo that it is Chriſt in the preaching of the Goſpel which is glad tydings for ſinners, remiſſion of ſins for believers, and this Goſpel, this glad tydings, cannot be rightly held forth to the world, but with all, men muſt be ſhewed that they are ſinners, and the emptineſſe of duties, all other foundations muſt be diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, the danger of not accepting Chriſt, &amp;c.
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:119599:134"/>this preaching of Chriſt and faith in oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition to all legall works and duties, is the means Chriſt hath appointed to bring men to the knowledge, both of himſelfe and them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves: it is true, every man and woman without faith, is bitten with the fiery ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, the fiery Law, but are not ſenſible of it, till Jeſus come in the preaching of the Goſpel, to diſcover it unto them.</p>
            <p>So that this is the reaſon why Chriſt is to be lifted up in the dayes of the Goſpel, that ſinners who behold him may live.</p>
            <p>This is the reaſon following my Text, <hi>That whoſoever believeth in him, may not pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh, but have everlaſting life,</hi> this is the main reaſon of the exaltation of Chriſt, that men believing may have life, this is ever annexed to the preaching of the Goſpel, <hi>Mar.</hi> 16.16. <hi>Goe preach the Goſpel to every creature, he that believeth and is baptized</hi> (that is, whoſe faith produceth obedience) <hi>ſhall be ſaved:</hi> This is the reaſon of the Goſpel preaching you ſee, and this is the reaſon why Chriſt came into the world, that men might have life through him, <hi>John</hi> 10.10. for this end God gave him, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 3.16. God had never ſent his Son into the world, had it not been that men by believing in him might have
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:119599:134"/>life: and therefore hath Chriſt left this Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance of preaching in the world, that men might be brought to believe, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thoſe men are (me thinks) much beſide the truth and the Goſpel, who pretend to hold forth Chriſt dying for all alike, and yet deny the preaching of the Goſpel, the means by which God brings over the ſoules of men and women to believe, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.17. <hi>Faith comes by hearing, and hearing by the Word of God,</hi> Thoſe who deny the preaching of the Goſpel, deny the meanes of working faith.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Queſt.</hi> But may every one that will, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Every one to whom God gives faith to believe, may and ſhall believe, for <hi>faith is the gift of God,</hi> Epheſ. 2.8. and God works faith by the preaching of the Goſpel, and this is the maine end of the exalting and lifting up of Chriſt in the Goſpel, that men by believing in him may have life, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is he to be lifted up as the ſerpent upon a pole, above all things, all duties, creatures, legall performances, any thing that the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture may reſt upon beneath him: Thus you ſee, beloved, the truth cleered, that Chriſt is to be exalted in the dayes of the Goſpel.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="252" facs="tcp:119599:135"/>
               <hi>Uſe,</hi> Generally three, 1 A word of Exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination, 2 Of Exhortation, 3 Of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation.</p>
            <p n="1">1 A word of Examination: and that is double: 1 For our ſelves in particular, what ſay you to this? Hath Chriſt been lifted up in your ſoules above all things? hath he had the preheminence above all? he who is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed above all, and in all, and through all? Have your ſouls ſeen Chriſt, the chiefe among ten thouſand? and is it ſtill ſo with you? are you ſatisfied with him as the wife with her husband, lying down in the boſom of love, content with him and him alone, ſeeing and enjoying all comfort and conſolation in him? Is Chriſt exalted in your ſoules as your a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone <hi>Prieſt</hi> and atonement, your peace-maker with God, or elſe doe you look upon any thing beneath Chriſt, as the ground of your peace? I feare me the Saints live too much below Chriſt, and that is the cauſe of ſo much ſadneſſe of ſpirit, reſting upon duties and le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gall performances, they deprive themſelves of much comfort they might otherwiſe enjoy.</p>
            <p n="2">2 Is Chriſt exalted as your alone Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet to teach you? are your eyes upon the Lord Jeſus in all his diſpenſations, expecting
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:119599:135"/>teaching from him? Is Chriſt exalted as King in thy ſoule? ſubmitting to him in all things, yielding uniuerſall obedience to him, and that out of love ſubmitting to all his laws and ſtatutes.</p>
            <p n="2">2 Examination, Whether Chriſt have been thus exalted in the Kingdom, in the Nation, as they deſire to ſtand to him under the relation of a Church as their Prieſt, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet and King, and in all theſe it would eaſily appear that he hath not been thus ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alted; he hath not been exalted the alone Prieſt and atonement indeed and in truth, but in word and ſhew, but duties, prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and qualifications, have been held forth with him, and that none but thoſe thus fitted and qualified might in any caſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve. Firſt, bringing men to the Law, and then to Chriſt, which is a legall way, and not evangelicall: it is true, the Jews were firſt brought to the Law and then to Chriſt, but under the Goſpel men are firſt to bee brought to the Goſpel to Chriſt, and then to duties of the Goſpel, for all preparations and qualifications whatſoever, which is not of faith, is ſin, and I am ſure faith comes by preaching of the Goſpel, not of the Law, <hi>Mar.</hi> 16.16, 17. Therefore the preaching of qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifications
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:119599:136"/>and preparations before faith, is ſin, for all things before, or without faith, is ſinne.</p>
            <p n="2">2 Hath Chriſt been received as the alone Prophet, to teach? hath his Word been made the rule of all actions, ſubmitting to him in all things, <hi>Act.</hi> 3.22, 23. any way? Judge of the truth of it.</p>
            <p n="3">3 Hath Chriſt been exalted as King, to ſubmit to him as the alone law giver of his Church of his people? hath not man been ſubmitted unto? hath not man ſate in the feare of God, making laws and conſtitutions of their own, compelling all thereunto, as once <hi>Darius</hi> made a Decree, <hi>Dan.</hi> 6. <hi>That all that ſhould aske any Petition of God or man for thirty dayes, ſhould be caſt into the den of lyons?</hi> ſo men ſet up themſelves, their own decrees, and compell unto it: this is not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable to the Kingly dominion of Chriſt: Chriſt hath not been exalted King, it is true, there hath been a name of Chriſt, but that is all: the power of Chriſt in all his offices, hath been rejected, and the truth is, that the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality have been wholy legall, fetching rules from the Law, from <hi>Moſes,</hi> and ſo denying Chriſt to be come in the fleſh.</p>
            <p>Legall churches, Nationall, as the Jews:
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:119599:136"/>legall Covenant of works made with the Jews, taken away to us that believe, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.9. legall preaching, ſetting up of works with Chriſt, when the Apoſtle ſayth, <hi>Hee that worketh not but believeth, &amp;c. Rom.</hi> 4. 4, 5. Legall Prieſts, the very title, and legall maintenance, tythes, but they that preach the Goſpel, live of the Goſpel. Legall adminiſtrations, I mean after legall rules, circumciſion, and the like, legall prayers and duties to make peace and atone ment: legall laws and inſtitutions compelling all to one worſhip, perſecuting the contrary minded, becauſe the Iews did ſo: thus be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved, hath the men of this and former Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerations, both in this and other Nations, raiſed up <hi>Moſes</hi> from the dead, and put his laws in execution, under the name of Chriſt: and ſo in deed and practice deny Chriſt to be come in the fleſh, although in word they ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge him: the Lord open their eyes that they may ſee farther into the myſtery of the Goſpel.</p>
            <p>In a word, Chriſt hath not been exalted as the brazen ſerpent upon a pole, above eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thing, all duties, prayers, ordinances, in the hearts of men, and that hath cauſed ſo many (as I cannot but judge gracious ſoules)
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:119599:137"/>to goe with ſorrow to their graves, ever kept in a way of working, under a legall bondage, no longer pray and be ſpirituall in duty, no longer comfort, as if a Chriſtian li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by prayer, preaching, and ordinances: no, no, beloved, they live above theſe, upon the Lord Jeſus by faith: not that the Saints ſhould not make uſe of theſe, but not live up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them: Chriſt is the Chriſtians life, and ſo far as he communicates himſelfe in theſe to the Chriſtian, he hath cauſe of joy, but if he deny himſelfe there: for the tryall of the ſoule, it is to let him ſee the emptineſſe of all things without himſelfe, and to cauſe the Chriſtian to live by faith, <hi>for we live by faith and not by ſenſe,</hi> 2 Cor. 5.7. But enough of this, here onely let the Saints who are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered out of this bondage, this ſpirituall, Babyloniſh, confuſed captivity, give God the Glory.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Uſe</hi> 2 A word of Exhortation to the ſervants of Jeſus: in all things to exalt and lift him up; to lift him up in preaching; in their hearts; in their obedience to him, that Chriſt may be all and in all to your ſoules: that you give up your ſelves a holy, living, acceptable, ſacrifice, to God, that you who have taken his name and truth upon you, exalt him as your
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:119599:137"/>alone <hi>Prieſt, Prophet, King,</hi> in your conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſations; that yee may be ſuch as become the Goſpel of Chriſt, holy, humble, full of love to all: <hi>as much as in you lyeth do good unto all, but eſpecially to the houſhold of faith:</hi> that ſo your light ſhining before men, they may have cauſe to glorifie your father which is in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven: and that gain-ſayers may be convinced by your godly converſtion: Beloved if you ſeeke the lifting up of Chriſt above all, then certainly your care will be, to live a Chriſt-like life while you are in this world.</p>
            <p n="3">3 And laſtly, a word of Conſolation, for poor ſinners: Chriſt is to be lifted up in the dayes of the Goſpel, that men by beleeving in him might have life by him: what doe you ſay to this? is there ever a ſoule preſent that wants faith, and is ſenſible of it, that wants life? Chriſt came to give life, he is lifted up now in the days of the Goſpel, for that very end and purpoſe, that dead men might have life by him. O is not here mercy! here is a way made whereby ſinners may become Saints, ſlayes may become ſons. <hi>Here is a fountaine opened for ſin, and for uncleanneſſe,</hi> if the Lord help your ſoules to waſh there. What ſay your ſouls to this? is there ever a poore creature bit with the fiery ſerpe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t with the ſenſe
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:119599:138"/>of the evill of ſin! O here is a Chriſt lifted up for that very end, and purpoſe that poore ſelf-deſtroying ſinners may come to him and live? Eſay 45.22. <hi>looke to me, and be yee ſaved, all the ends of the earth:</hi> O here is bleſſed newes, a bleſſed word for ſinners if the Lord give you hearts to make uſe of it! Chriſt excludes none, to whome he gives a heart to receive him: is it not a mercy that God hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided an object for dead ſoules to looke upon, and live? Truly beloved, it is the richeſt mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy in the world, where God gives a heart to accept it.</p>
            <p>Here is diſcovered the bleſſed condition of the poore deſpiſed Saints. O they are in a ſaved condition, thoſe to whom Chriſt hath given faith. O they have cauſe to rejoyce overmore, they have cauſe to be filled with Joy and peace, <hi>Joy unſpeakable and full of glory.</hi> What if they are reproached, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuted for the name and ſake of CHRIST their Saviour, their Husband, their All in, the delight of their ſoules? yet they are happy, and they ſhall never periſh, but they ſhall one day be freed from all theſe enemies, <hi>and when Chriſt who is their life ſhall appeare, they ſhall appeare with him in glory:</hi> that Chriſt who is lifted up high in
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:119599:138"/>their hearts, in their ſouls here, will lift them up one day as high as himſelfe in glory, a<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>bove devill, above men, above ſin, and ſet them with himſelf where they ſhall en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy pleaſure without ſorrow, felowſhip with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out mixture, and ſing prayſes and Halelujahs without end.</p>
